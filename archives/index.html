  <p align="left" class="site-description">
  My research interests are mainly about language processing, and I hope to use a variety of technologies
  to explore the mysteries of human language and the brain. To be more specific, I'm interested in the cognitive
  and neural mechanism underlying human language processing. I want to combine computational models and neural
  signals to understand it.
  I have done some language-related work in my past research training while honing my foundational skills in
  research on other cognitive funcitons (like working memory).
  Here are my major research projects.
  <br>
  <br>

<br>
<br>
  <h1>Language </h1>
<br>
<br>
  <p><strong>Lateralization of Language Brain Networks: A Graph Theory Study</strong></p>
  <p align="left" class="site-description">
  In this research, I used graph theory to examine substantial lateralization in the
  topological properties of language brain networks and how they relate to behaviors.
  This work has been postered at OHBM 2022 Annual Meeting. I'm now examining the brain-
  behavior associations and the genetic heredity of the topological properties.
  <br>
  <br>
  I learned how to do brain connectivity analysis using fMRI and some basic knowledge about graph theory.
  And my understanding of language brain networks was also deepened. I'm now working on the manuscript.

  <p><strong>Interpretable and Table-structured Abstractive Text Summarization</strong></p>
   <p align="left" class="site-description">
   This is my research in natural language processing in the Project-based Learning Program organized by MIT.
   In this research, I developed a text summarization algorithm with higher interpretability and more controllable output.
   It will first extract information (like entities, POS, etc.) and construct a structured table. After linearization,
   it will be imported to a fine-tuned T5-small model and get the final summaries.
   <br>
   <br>
   This project made me an interdisciplinary student. I mastered the python language and become familiar with natural
   language processing by this program. It made me realize that language can be studied in many ways and aspects.
   <br>

  <h1>Working Memory </h1>
<br>
<br>
  <p><strong>Posterior Activities During Encoding and Early Delay Support the Context Binding During Visual Working Memory</strong></p>
  <p align="left" class="site-description">
  In this research, I explored a more effective behavioral paradigm to distinguish misbinding
  errors and informed guesses in the delayed recall paradigm by combining model fitting and individual reporting. I conducted
  EEG experiments and analyzed EEG signals (ERP, alpha power) to explore neural activity differences in different
  cognitive states to elucidate the neural activities closely related to feature binding in visual working memory.
  Preliminary results have been submitted to the CNS(Chinese Neuroscience Community) as a conference abstract.
  <br>
  <br>
  This project made me think more about what scientific research is and how to scientific research in psychology. I also learned
  EEG signal acquisition and analysis. Although I may not continue to explore the topic of working memory in the future,
  this program enabled me to accumulate basic research skills.

  <br>
  <p><strong>Spatial and Non-spatial Working Memory Recall Are Substantially Different: an Exploration
  Based on the Feature-binding Theory </strong></p>
  <p align="left" class="site-description">
  In this work, I used the three-factor mixed response model (Bays, 2009) and the two-dimensional recall model (Grogan et al., 2019)
  to fit behavioral responses. I proved that the guessing rate is much lower in location recall tasks, and this has nothing to
  do with dots dimension, the way of presentation, and set size.
  <br>
  <br>
  It can be called my introductory project for scientific research. It was a behavioral experiment in which I learned data
  collection, model fitting, and some basic data analysis methods. It was also the first time for me to make a poster,
  and the poster won the student Best Poster award in the scientific research achievements exhibition of our department,
  which encouraged me very much.

  <h1>Modeling </h1>
<br>
<br>
  <p><strong>A Simulation-Based Analysis of Fungi </strong></p>
  <p align="left" class="site-description">
  I participated in the Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM/ICM) 2021 and this work won the
  Meritorious Winner Prize. In this work, I used the differential equation model and the cellular
  automata to simulate the interaction of different types of fungi.
  <br>
  <br>
  This work improved my modeling skills and practiced my writing. It was the first time for me to
  participate in mathematical modeling. I was so excited to win the Meritorious Winner Prize.

  </p>

<br>
<br>
  <p><strong> Machine Learning Reveals Hemispheric Differences in the Human Brain </strong></p>
  <p align="left" class="site-description">
  I helped with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model and reviewed and edited the abstract paper.
  This work has a poster presentation in OHBM 2022 Annual Meeting, too.
  <br>
  <br>
  This work enhanced my programming and modeling skills. I'm excited to combine artificial intelligence models
  with brain data to understand the features of human brain.
