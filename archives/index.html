  My research interests are mainly about language, and I hope to use a variety of technologies
  to explore the mysteries of human language and the brain. I have done some language-related work
  in my past research training, while honing my foundational skills in research on other topics
  (like working memory). Here are my major research projects.
  <br>
  <br>

<br>
<br>
  <h1>Language </h1>
<br>
<br>
  <p><strong>Lateralization of Language Brain Networks: A Graph Theory Study</strong></p>
  <p align="left" class="site-description">
  In this research, I used graph theory to examine substantial lateralization in the
  topological properties of language brain networks and how they related to behaviors.
  This work has been postered at OBHM 2022 Annual Meeting.
  <br>
  <br>
  I learnt how to do brain connectivity analysis and some basic knowledge about graph theory.
  And my understanding of language brain networks was also deepened. Further research will be
  carried out on the basis of this work in my following year.
  <br>

  </p>

  <br>
  <p><strong>Interpretable and Table-structured Abstractive Text Summarization</strong></p>
   <p align="left" class="site-description">
   This is my research in natural language processing in the Project-based Learning Program organized by MIT.
   In this research, I developed a text summarization algorithm with higher interpretability and more controllable output.
   It will first extract information (like entities, POS, etc.) and construct a structured table. After linearalization,
   it will be imported to a fine-tuned T5-small model and get the final summaries.
   <br>
   <br>
   This project made me an interdisciplinary student. I mastered the python language and become familiar with natural
   language processing by this program. It made me realize that language can be studied in many ways and aspects.
   <br>

<br>
<br>
  <h1>Working Memory </h1>
<br>
<br>
  <p><strong>The Neural Mechanism Underlying Content-Context Binding in Visual Working Memory</strong></p>
  <p align="left" class="site-description">
  The work is in progress. In this research, I'm exploring a more effective behavioral paradigm to distinguish mis-binding
  errors and informed guesses in the delayed recall paradigm by combining model fitting and individual reporting. I'm analyzing
  EEG signals to explore neural activity differences in different cognitive states to elucidate the neural activities
  closely related to feature binding in visual working memory.
  <br>
  <br>
  This project made me thinking more about what science research is and how to science research in psychology. I also learnt
  EEG signal acquisition and analysis. Although I may not continue to explore the topic of working memory in the future,
  this program enabled me to accumulate basic research skills.
  </p>

  <br>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Spatial and Non-spatial Working Memory Recall Are Substantially Different: an Exploration
  Based on the Feature-binding Theory </strong></p>
  <p align="left" class="site-description">
  In this work, I used three-factor mixed response model (Bays, 2009) and two-dimensional recall model (Grogan et al., 2019)
  to fit behavioral responses. I proved that guessing rate is much lower in location recall tasks, and this has nothing to
  do with dots dimension, the way of presentation, and set size.
  <br>
  <br>
  It can be called my introductory project for scientific research. It was a behavioral experiment in which I learned data
  collection, model fitting and some basic data analysis methods. It was also the first time for me to make a poster,
  and the poster won the student Best Poster award in the scientific research achievements exhibition of our department,
  which encouraged me very much.

  <h1>Modelling </h1>
<br>
<br>
  <p><strong>A Simulation Based Analysis of Fungi </strong></p>
  <p align="left" class="site-description">
  I participated in the Mathematical Contest in Modeling (MCM/ICM) 2021 and this work won the
  Meritorious Winner Prize. In this work, I used the differential equation model and the cellular
  automata to simulate the interaction of different types of fungi.
  <br>
  <br>
  This work improved my modelling skills and practiced my writing. It was the first time for me to
  participate in mathematical modeling. I was so excited to win the Meritorious Winner Prize.
