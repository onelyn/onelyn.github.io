<p>To understand others, the first trap is getting over yourself, to recognize that others may view the world differently.</p>
<p>Understand that others have different points of view is a realization you grew into rather than you grew up with. -&gt; children: self-centered.</p>
<p>Childhood instincts are not outgrown so much as they are overcome by more careful and reflective thinking.</p>
<p>When two different necks are pointing their heads in different directions, they are attending to different information and basing their evaluations on fundamentally different viewpoints. -&gt; neck problem</p>
<p>You can look at the same thing using different lenses of interpretation. -&gt; lens problem</p>
<p>When researchers ask people to compare themselves with others, the answers they get seem to be based more heavily on themselves than on others.</p>
<p>Over-estimate not only positive things but also negative things of ourselves. (self-centered over-claiming)</p>
<p>Think that others should give you more credit than they actually do is a part of egocentric tendencies.</p>
<p>You can't identify exactly how your own interpretation is being influenced by the lens you view it through.</p>
<p>You look <em>through</em> it instead of <em>at</em> it.</p>
<p>Your own beliefs serve as a lens for understanding what others are likely to believe, as well as how strongly they are likely to believe it. But your mind contains multitudes, and beliefs are not the only lens that can alter your perception. Knowledge can also do it.</p>
<p>curse of knowledge: lens problem. You can't imagine what it's like not to possess it.</p>
<p>The less we know about the mind of another, the more we use our own to fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>People tend to think God is <em>on my side</em>. Reasoning about God's beliefs looked the same as reasoning about one's own beliefs.</p>
<p>You don't overcome the lens problem by trying harder to imagine another person's perspective. You overcome it by actually being in that perspective, or hearing directly from some who has been in it.</p>
<p>Learn that someone is a member of a different group than you, you will drop egocentrism and pick up a stereotype to reason about that person's mind instead.</p>
<h1 id="the-uses-and-abuses-of-stereotypes">The Uses and Abuses of Stereotypes</h1>
<p>Your stereotypes are sometimes right, especially when predicting the direction of differences. But often wrong when predicting the size of those differences.</p>
<p>The sense is a stereotype, a set of beliefs about the personal characteristics of a group. They reflect your brain's general attempt to extract average tendencies from a complicated world.</p>
<p>When you've just seen a large group, it's nearly impossible to remember the individuals. But mistakes are almost perfectly predictable, and reflecting your brain's brilliance. Often brain is averaging the group. The gist of a group its the group's average.</p>
<p>Stereotypes are rarely completely accurate or inaccurate.</p>
<p>Three ways why our stereotypes go wrong: getting too little information, defining groups by their differences, being unable to observe the true causes of group differences directly.</p>
<p>Stereotypes are more accurate when you've had direct experience with a group, know a lot about the group in question, and are asked about clearly visible facts.</p>
<p>Common stereotype that women are more emotional than men: whether behavioral differences reflect the emotions people <em>feel</em> or just the emotions they <em>show</em> to others.</p>
<p>Some pieces of evidence are easier to ignore than others. Tend to say more about differences.</p>
<p>A group defined by its similarity to others is no group at all. Does not affect how they actually <em>are</em> but affect how they <em>look</em>.</p>
<p>When groups are defined by their differences, people think they have less in common with people of other races or faiths or genders than they actually do and avoid even talking with them.</p>
<p>Group differences are also meaningful. -&gt; team</p>
<p>Even if the prevailing stereotypes about aging are negative within a culture, glimmers of positive stereotypes exist as well. The older function better when they're thinking about the positive stereotypes</p>
<p>There are certainly many reasons, but one seems to involve knowing the stereotypes associated with your own group's expected performance.</p>
<p>They behave differently because of stereotypes about these groups rather than because of any <em>inherent differences</em> between theses groups that our brain's statistician observes.</p>
<p>Our impressions about the minds of others seem to reflect the world we observe. Stereotypes seem like mirrors. And can also act like magnets.</p>
<h1 id="how-actions-can-mislead">How Actions Can Mislead</h1>
<p>Correspondence bias: people show how they feel, choose what they want and do as they please.</p>
<p>Judging a mind based only on a person's behavior can resemble flat-earth thinking because understanding the mind of any person requires a broader perspective than our experience routinely provides.</p>
<p>Even people know, common sense can occupy - actors &amp; their characters.</p>
<p>This strong form of the correspondence bias declines in American and British children around the age of nine or ten, and that it does so because children learn to overcome their first instinct with more careful thought rather than dropping their first instinct altogether. Even if careful thought suggests otherwise, the first instinct is still to assume that actions are produced by corresponding intentions.</p>
<p>A sixth sense that assumes that a person's mind corresponds directly to his/her actions misses the importance of context in shaping behavior, misunderstands the causes of behavior and is unable to change anyone's behavior for the better, including one's own.</p>
