<blockquote>
<h3 id="brain-development">Brain Development</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>Roman: embryo is a small adult &amp;&amp; simply to grow bigger.</p>
<p>early 20th century: brain development reflected a series of stages (broadly two). First, a genetically determined sequence of events in utero子宫 that can be modulated by maternal environment. Second, both prenatal and postnatal产后, the connectivity of the brain is very sensitive to the environment and to the patterns of brain activity produced by <strong>experiences</strong>.  <em>epigenetic后生说 outcomes including regulation of gene expression are based upon mechanisms other than DNA itself --&gt; gene expression can be altered by specific experiences and in turn lead to organizational changes in the nervous system.</em></p>
<h4 id="stages-of-brain-development">Stages of brain development</h4>
<p>general stages characteristic of brain development in all mammals:</p>
<p>cell birth -&gt; cell migration -&gt; cell differentiation -&gt; cell maturation (dendrite树突 and axon轴突 growth) -&gt; synaptogenesis突触形成 -&gt; cell death and synaptic pruning -&gt; myelogenesis</p>
<p>Fertilization -&gt; three weeks after: cells (to produce the nervous system) begin to form (form the neural tube, later called the subventricular室下 zone -&gt;  six weeks of age: cells that form the cerebrum大脑 begin division -&gt; 14 weeks: the cerebrum looks distinctly human -&gt; 5 months: most neurogenesis is complete <strong>expect being cells in the hippo-campus (which continues to form neurons throughout life)</strong> -&gt; 7 months: sulci沟 and gyri回 begin to form.</p>
<p>Cerebral cortex in each hemisphere: ten billion cells</p>
<p>250,000 neurons per minute</p>
<p>Once the neurons are formed, they begin to migrate along fibrous pathways formed by radial放射状的 glial胶质 cells &amp; extend from the subventricular zone to the surface of the cerebral cortex. <strong>The cells formed in a particular subventricular region migrate to a certain cortical location.</strong> As the cells reached destination they will be steered to differentiating into a particular cell type.</p>
<p>The formation of dendrites begins prenatally in humans but continues long after birth (slow). Two year after: spines脊柱 (location of most excitatory synapses) are formed.  **Axons grow faster **-&gt; reach another cell the dendrites of that cell are completely formed -&gt; influence dendritic differentiation and the formation of cerebral circuits.</p>
<p><strong>Synapse formation is too large -&gt; only the general outlines of neural connections will be genetically predetermined &amp; the vast array of synapses is guided by a variety of environmental cues and signals</strong></p>
<p>Uncertainty in the number of neurons that will reach appropriately -&gt; the brain overproduces -&gt; cell death and synaptic pruning to remove the unwanted (forms like epigenetic signals, experiences, gonadal hormone性腺激素, stress etc) -&gt; the cortex become thinner in a caudal尾-rostral头 gradient梯度  <strong>The thinner is better rule.</strong></p>
<p><em><s>Notice: one behavioral development may correlate with many regions</s></em></p>
<p>Normal adult function is attained only after myelination is complete, which is after 18 years of age in regions such as the prefrontal, posterior parietal后顶叶区 and anterior temporal cortex.</p>
<p>**Experiences are essentially acting on very different brains at different stages of development. **</p>
<h4 id="special-features-of-brain-development">Special features of brain development</h4>
<p>Two especially important features:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cells lining the subventricular zone are stem根源 cells that remain active throughout life. They stay quiescent静止的 for extended periods but can be activated to produce neurons/glia. Their generation can be influenced by many factors including experience, drugs, hormones and injury.</li>
<li>Dendrites and spines show remarkable plasticity in response to experience (overproduction and pruning). <em>There are differences between early brain and later brain in synapses' formation.</em> Early &quot;expecting&quot; experiences and are diffusely扩散 throughout the cerebrum. Later ones are more focal焦点的 and localized to regions involved in processing specific experiences (experiences lead to selective synapse formation and loss -&gt; change neural networks by adding and pruning synapses -&gt; brain plasticity) . <strong>experience-expectant vs experience-dependent</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="general-principles-of-plasticity-in-normal-brain">General Principles of Plasticity in Normal Brain</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>key principles of plasticity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Changes in the brain can be shown at many levels of analysis (global, molecular分子, calcium channels cell morphology形态学 etc)</li>
<li>Different measures of neuronal morphology change independently of each other and sometimes in opposite directions. <strong>Thus changes in spine density密度 ≠ changes in dendritic length.</strong></li>
<li>Experience-dependent changes tend to be focal. <em>A failure to find synaptic changes that correlate with behavioral change is note evidence of the absence of changes.</em> <em>Notice: experience's global nature.</em></li>
<li>Plastic changes are time-dependent. They are not permanent.</li>
<li>Experience-dependent changes interact. Later experiences have a much-attenuated effect.</li>
<li>Plastic changes are age-dependent. The developing brain will be more responsive to experiences. <strong>There are qualitatively different changes in the brain in response to the same experience at different ages.</strong></li>
<li>Not all plasticity is good. Plastic changes can interfere with behavior too.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="factors-influencing-brain-development">Factors Influencing Brain Development</h3>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Even fairly innocuous-looking experiences can profoundly affect brain development.</strong></p>
<h4 id="sensory-and-motor-experiences">Sensory and motor experiences</h4>
<p><em>By raising animals in deprived environments and compare with those in standard environments.</em></p>
<p>Visual:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Decrease : Weisel and Hubel (1963): sutured缝合 one eyelid of kittens closed and later showed that when the eye was opened there was an enduring loss of spatial vision (amblyopia弱视)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enhance: Prusky (2008): rats were placed in a virtual optokinetic视动 system in which vertical lines of differing spatial frequency moved past the animal. <em>If the eyes are open and oriented towards the moving grating, it is impossible for animals to avoid tracking the moving lines if the spatial frequency is within the perceptual range.</em> Postnatal day 15 is the day of eye opening. --&gt; visual enhancement <strong>Not based upon specific training but naturally enhanced visual input.</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tactile触觉:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhance: Schanberg and Field (1987): Infant rats were given tactile stimulation with a small brush for 15 minutes three times per day for 10-15 days beginning at birth. When they were adult they have enhanced skilled motor performance and spatial learning &amp; changes in synaptic organization across the cerebral cortex.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>By placing animals in complex environments in which there is an opportunity for animals to interact with a changing sensory and social environment and to engage in far more motor activity than regular caging.</em></p>
<p>Increases in brain size, cortical thickness, neuron size, dendritic branching, spine density, synapses per neuron, glial numbers and complexity, vascular血管 arborization分支.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>experience-dependent changes at any age</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>adult rats at any age show a large increase in dendritic length and spine density across most of the cerebral cortex</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>juvenile rats show a similar increase in dendritic length but a decrease in spine density</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pregnant dams were placed in complex environments for 8 hours a day prior to their pregnancy and then throughout the 3-week gestation妊娠, they show a decrease in dendritic length and an increase in spine density</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>=&gt;</p>
<ol>
<li>A wide range of sensory and motor experiences can produce long-lasting plastic changes in the brain.</li>
<li>The same experience can alter the brain differently at different ages.</li>
<li>There's no simple relationship between the details of synaptic plasticity and behavior during development.</li>
<li>Early experiences have a powerful effect on brain organization both during development an in adulthood.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="psychoactive-drugs">Psychoactive drugs</h4>
<p><em>Not only alcohol but also prescription处方 drugs can alter brain development</em></p>
<p>Robinson and Kolb (2004): exposure to psychomotor stimulants in adulthood -&gt; changes in the structure of cells in PFC前额皮层 and NAcc(nucleus accumbens伏隔核) &amp;&amp; effects are different in different regions</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Amphetamine/Methylphenidate given during the juvenile period:</p>
<p><em>安非他命，中枢兴奋剂。利他能，治多动症。对比组用生理盐水saline</em></p>
<p>Both altered the organization of the PFC. Dendritic changes were associated with abnormal play behavior (reduced play initiation启动 and impaired performance of working memory).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Antipsychotics抗精神病/Antidepressants/Anxiolytics:</p>
<p>Adult mice (but developmental stages corresponding to fetal婴儿 or fetal and early childhood stages in human) -&gt; reduce dendritic length, dendritic branching complexity and spine density in mPFC and orbital眶 cortex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Diazepam安定/Fluoxetine氟西汀(抗抑郁):</p>
<p>Prenatal diazepam increased dendritic length and spine density in pyramidal cells in the parietal顶叶 cortex. Fluoxetine decreased them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: Whether early exposure to psychoactive drugs might alter brain plasticity later in life?</p>
<p>A: Yes. Early drug exposure blocked the expected experience-dependent changes in the cortex.  -&gt; The effects are over-lasting.</p>
<h4 id="gonadal-hormones">Gonadal hormones</h4>
<p><em>The most obvious effect: the differentiation of genitals that begin prenatally.</em></p>
<p>testosterone雄性激素 estrogen雌性激素 will affect receptors in many regions of the body including the brain.</p>
<p>The total volume of brain reaches asymptote渐近线：</p>
<ul>
<li>11 years old in females</li>
<li>15 years old in males</li>
</ul>
<p>Neurons in rats:</p>
<ul>
<li>in mPFC: larger dendritic fields in males</li>
<li>in OFC: larger cells in females</li>
</ul>
<p>gonadal hormones alter cortical development</p>
<p><strong>The effects of other experiences such as exposure to complex housing or psychomotor stimulants are also sexually dimorphic二性的</strong></p>
<h4 id="parent-child-relationships">Parent-child relationships</h4>
<p><em>Mammalian infants are born in an immature state and will face challenges</em></p>
<p>Parent-child relationships play a key role in brain development.</p>
<ul>
<li>Differences in the pattern of early maternal-infant interactions can initiate long-term developmental effects that persist into adulthood.</li>
<li>The effects of variations are not restricted to the hippo-campus, but also may be quite wide-spread. eg: enhanced maternal care during the first week of life -&gt; changes in cell signaling pathways in the hypothalamus丘脑下部 and amgydala周围的</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Still unaware of neocortical (especially PFC) plasticity with maternal-infant interactions.</strong></p>
<p><s>Daily maternal separation to increase maternal-infant interactions?</s></p>
<h4 id="peer-relationships">Peer relationships</h4>
<p><em>One of the most powerful peer relationship is play (important for the development of adult social competence)</em></p>
<p>The frontal lobe额叶 is essential to play behavior (both mPFC and OFC)</p>
<p>-&gt; Guess: manipulate the play behavior can also alter the PF regions</p>
<p>Juvenile rats were given the opportunity to pay with 1 or 3 adult rats or with other 1 or 3 juvenile animals. -&gt; Virtually no play with the adult but was increase the more juvenile animals that were present.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Neurons of the OFC responded to the number of peers present.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Neurons of the mPFC responded to the amount of play.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Early experiences that alter rat play behavior:</p>
<ul>
<li>prenatal stress</li>
<li>postnatal tactile stimulation</li>
<li>juvenile exposure to methylphenidate</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="early-stress">Early stress</h4>
<p><em>perinatal出生前后的 stress in infants</em></p>
<p><em>both gestational妊娠的 and infant stress predisposes individuals for many maladaptive适应不良的 behaviors and psychopathologies</em></p>
<p><strong>The plastic changes in the synaptic organization of brains of perinatally-stressed animals are less well studied.</strong> And the effects appear to be related to the details of the stressful experience.</p>
<p>Murmu (2006): moderate prenatal stress during the third week of gestation  -&gt; decreased spine density and dendritic length in both the mPFC and OFC of adult degus八齿鼠</p>
<p><strong>contrast</strong> Muhammad (2011): mild prenatal stress during the second week of gestation -&gt; decreased spine density in mPFC but no effect in OFC and INCREASED spine density in NAcc伏隔核 of adult rats</p>
<p>Mychasiuk (2011): mild stress during the second -&gt; increased spine density in both mPFC and OFC <strong>when the brains were examined in juvenile rather than adult rats</strong></p>
<p>==&gt; differences in the timing (stress) and the age (examined) -&gt; differing plastic changes</p>
<p><strong>The effects of prenatal stress is different from those of adult stress</strong></p>
<p>eg. Liston (2006): adult stress -&gt; decrease in dendritic branching and spine density in mPFC but an increase in OFC</p>
<p><strong>The effects of early postnatal stress (maternal separation) on synaptic organization in adult brains are less researched.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And how the changes relate to later behavior/how plastic the neurons will be in response to other experiences?</strong></p>
<h4 id="intestinal肠-flora菌群">Intestinal肠 flora菌群</h4>
<p>eg. gut肠道 microbiota微生物 -&gt; effects on liver肝脏 function</p>
<p>relation: neuro-developmental disorders (autism自闭症, schizophrenia精神分裂症, etc) &amp;&amp; microbioal pathogen病菌 infections</p>
<p><strong>Such infections could alter brain and behavioral development.</strong></p>
<p>Diaz (2002): mice, with/without normal gut mircrobiota -&gt; gut bacteria influence signaling pathways, neuro-transmitter turnover, and the production of synaptic-related proteins in cortex and striatum条纹 in developing mice -&gt; these changes were associated with changes in motor functions</p>
<h4 id="diet">Diet</h4>
<p><em>presume that the body heals better when it is given good nutrition</em></p>
<p>-&gt; brain development might be facilitated by vitamin and/or mineral supplements</p>
<p>eg. Perinatal choline维生素B复合体之一 supplementation leads to enhanced spatial memory in various spatial navigation导航 tests and increases the levels of nerve growth factor in the hippo-campus and neocortex.</p>
<p>Halliwell (2011): the effects of the addition of a vitamin/mineral supplement to the food of lactating哺乳期 rats.</p>
<ul>
<li>use a diet supplement (has been reported to improve mood and aggression in adults and adolescents with various disorders &amp;&amp;decreased anger, activity levels and social withdrawal in autism with an increase in spontaneity自发性)</li>
<li>analysis of the adult offspring后代 of lactating rats -&gt; an increase in dendritic length in neurons in mPFC and parietal cortex but not in OFC</li>
<li>the diet was effective in reversing the effects of mild prenatal stress on the reduction of dendritic length in OFC</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The effects of both dietary restriction and supplementation are left to be learned.</strong> How to interact with later experiences ?</p>
<blockquote>
<h3 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>Experiences are not singular events but rather as we go through life, experiences interact to alter both behavior and brain, a process often referred to as metaplasticity.</p>
<p>Use &quot;the developing brain&quot; like a single time but still unknown the time in which the developing brain is more/less responsive than at other times.</p>
<p>Different cerebral regions will response at different times. (eg. motor cortex injured in early adolescence -&gt; poor outcome at late adolescence)</p>
<p>Plastic changes in brain organization can be studied at many other levels besides the synaptic plasticity. Ultimately the fundamental mechanism of synaptic change will be found in gene expression. The difficulty is that it is likely that experiences that alter behaviors significantly will be related to changes in dozens or hundreds of genes. The challenge is to identify the changes that are most closely associated with the observed behavioral changes.</p>
