    Hello, I'm Yinuo Liu (also call me Nicole Liu). I'm in my third year studying psychology at Zhejiang University, China. I've also learned courses in various academic fields include psycholinguistics, neuroscience, machine learning, artificial intelligence, data analysis and so on. My personal research interests focus on language and working memory, and I have posted one of my research in OHBM 2022 Annual Meeting.

                <h2 id="phenomenological-misgivings">Phenomenological misgivings</h2>
<p>Lipps 's theory of empathy accepts the basic but questionable assumption that all we can be said to perceive is physical qualities and their changes, such as the distortion of facial muscles, and that this perceptual input is psychologically meaningless. It is only by animating what is perceptually given with what we know from our own case that we can come to know that we are encountering another minded creature. It is only by drawing on our own inner experience that we are able to move from the input to the actual ascription to others of mental states, such as joy or happiness.</p>
<p>Gurwitsch doubted the claim that the inner imitation constitutes the basis of empathy. It might explain why a certain experience occurs in me but not how I come to understand the other. (to be happy myself and to believe another is happy)</p>
<p>Lipps argue that empathy involves two steps: imitation and projection. My perception of the other's expression will evoke a feeling in myself, and the feeling is then attributed to the other through projection.</p>
<p>Our emotional reaction doesn't have to be the same. It is exactly that: a reaction. We don't need a emotion ourselves necessarily.</p>
<p>Stein: empathy is a form of other-directed intentionality.</p>
<h2 id="scheler">Scheler</h2>
<p>Social understanding is not primarily a theoretical matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>merely see a certain distortion of the facial muscles, don't see it as emotionally expressive</li>
<li>see it emotionally expressive but without feeling any concern</li>
<li>feel concern or compassion</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to feel concern/sympathy, you first need to realize or recognize that the other is indeed suffering. Prior cognitive understanding.</p>
<p>It is possible to empathize with somebody while being indifferent to his plight. Sympathy doesn't necessarily have a positive moral value. It depends on the situation and the character of the emotional response.</p>
<p>Deny that our capacity to recognize and understand the expressions of others is enabled and conditioned by the emotional response.</p>
<p>In emotional contagion the feeling you are infected by is phenomenally given not as belonging to another but as your own. It's only its origin pointing to the other. But sympathy and empathy are not only self-consciousness, but also a felt separation between self and other.</p>
<p>One can be infected by the feelings of others, not only without knowing anything about the other individuals but also without knowing anything about their intentional objects.</p>
<p>Emotional sharing: dependent of each other, interdependent, requires and involves not only similarity but also a preservation of difference as well as an amount of mutual understanding.</p>
<p>Emotion joy and empathic understanding of joy can be qualitatively different and distinct.</p>
<p>Scheler: a perceptual theory of other minds - empathy</p>
<p>Empathy is what allows me to experience other subjects.</p>
<p>Reject the proposal that empathy should be based on a direct association between cues and one's own similar past experiences. Argue to what degree can we grasp another person's state of mind directly in the available expressive phenomena.</p>
<p>Dismisses the suggestion that the empathizer must at the very least have been first-personally acquainted with some of the basic elements of the empathized experience. Q: how specific the match must be in order to count as significantly similar</p>
<p>Deny that we can only understand experiences in others that we have ourselves undergone in the past.</p>
<p>There are also cases that we can't intuit the other's experiences. (limitation)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bodily sensations: through reproduction I can only at most feel the emotion. If I want to know what it is like for you to taste juice, I have to taste myself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How far expressions will get us: dimensions of the mind that aren't tied to bodily expressions. Until the other decides to reveal and communicate them. Language is essential for higher forms of social understanding.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>My own body, felt by me, does not correspond point by point to the other's body as it is visually presented to me. I need to adopt a more global perspective to grasp the similarities.</p>
<p>Doubt:</p>
<ul>
<li>my point of departure is my own consciousness</li>
<li>we never have direct access to another person's mind (never experience but only infer)</li>
</ul>
<p>-&gt; Scheler: we are confronted neither with a mere body nor with a pure soul but with the unity of an embodied mind. (expressive unity)</p>
<p>Our primary knowledge of nature is knowledge of expressive phenomena, and the most fundamental form of perception is the perception of the psychophysically undifferentiated expression. The knowledge of a living world is taken to precede our knowledge of a dead and mechanical world. At fist we see everything as expressive and we then go through a process of de-animation, instead of seeing inanimate objects and then animating them through a subsequent addition of mental components. Learning is &quot;de-souling&quot; rather than &quot;en-souling&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="husserl-and-stein">Husserl and Stein</h2>
<h3 id="empathy-and-perception">Empathy and perception</h3>
<p>For Stein, empathy is quite generally the term of choice for the experience of another consciousness.</p>
<p>How to understand the intentional structure of empathy:</p>
<p>Husserl: distinguish between signitive, pictorial, and perceptual ways of intending an object (related ways);  only perception is direct.</p>
<p>Others' experiences can never be given to me in the same original fashion as my own experiences, they are not accessible to me through inner consciousness. Rather, they are appresented through a special form of apperception, or to use a different terminology, they are co-intended and characterized by a certain co-presence.</p>
<p>Empathy is unlike perception in that it doesn't give us its object, the empathized experience, originally. Stein rejects that empathy should make us undergo the emotion we perceive in the other. I lack a <em>first-person experience</em> but I <em>experience</em> (perceptually) rather than <em>imagine or infer</em> (indirect comprehension).</p>
<p>Husserl distinguish two different attitudes that we can take towards the other: naturalistic/personalistic.</p>
<ul>
<li>naturalistic: the other's body is given to us as a material unity; the other's experiential life is then posited as a founded stratum.</li>
<li>personalistic: the other is from the beginning given in a unified manner as a person; not a conjunction of two realities.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I perceive an object, the object is never given in its totality but always incompletely. Our perceptual consciousness is characterized that we persistently transcend the intuitively given profile in order to grasp the object itself (full object-consciousness). Our intuitive consciousness of the present profile of the object is accompanied by an intentional consciousness of the object's horizon of absent profiles.  Even ordinary perception involves apperception.</p>
<p>There are differences between empathy and object perception. We can grasp the other and what he/she is living through much more vividly; but the objected can be in turn present if required while the other's experiences can't.</p>
<p>Even the most perfect perception of the psychical life of another lacks the originality of self-perception. It can't give us the empathized experience itself in its original presence.</p>
<p>My experiential acquaintance with the mind of the other differs from my first-person acquaintance with my own mind. The minds we experience are <em>other</em> minds. Although I do not have access to the first-personal character of the other's experience, the fact that there is more to the other's experience than what I am grasping is salient to me.</p>
<p>Compare Scheler and Husserl/Stein:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scheler: we can experience not only our own experiences but also those of another, through a kind of inner experience or intuition.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scheler defines inner intuition as an act that grasps the psychical, regardless of whether it is my own or that of the other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scheler: there are dimensions of the other that are absolutely inaccessible to others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="coupling-and-analogical-transference">Coupling and analogical transference</h3>
<p>Our empathic understanding of another subjectivity involves an element of apperception or interpretation. Central notion: coupling (pairing)</p>
<p>Coupling: patterns of understanding are gradually established through a process of sedimentation沉积作用 and they thereby come to influence subsequent experiences. My previous experiences influence my current understanding.</p>
<p>Mutual transfer of sense. I draw on what I know from my own case, but through my encounter with the other, my own self-experience is also modified. (bi-directional)</p>
<p>A process of analogizing doesn't lead to the apprehension of anything truly new.</p>
<p>Empathy is not a kind of reproduction or reduplication of oneself. (imagine: to happen myself)</p>
<p>Motivation of an analogizing apprehension or apperceptive transfer of sense: a perceived similarity between the body over there and my own body.</p>
<p>But I don't perceive my own lived body as a spatial object. ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The appearance of the other bod reminds me of the possible appearance of my own body, reminds me of what my own body would look like if it appeared over there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My lived body is also continuously externalizing itself and that this exteriority is co-given as an integral part of my own bodily self-experience.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Inner and outer bodily perception.</p>
<p>My self-experience can constitute the model or matrix/simply against which the other's difference and transcendence can reveal itself. (to be referred [project oneself in to the other] or just to distinguish [pre-condition for other-experience])</p>
<h3 id="the-objects-and-levels-of-empathy">The objects and levels of empathy</h3>
<p>Assumptions: empathy is a unitary concept; its object is the other subject.</p>
<p>Stein: other-experience - try to understand and don't view it as an object - an understood other-experience</p>
<p>Most fundamental form of empathy: allow us to apprehend the perceptually given body as a lived body (sensual empathy)</p>
<p>Husserl's model: sensing and perceiving empathy; appresentation of the other; purposefulness of the action and grasps; appropriating foreign tradition.</p>
<p>Husserl denies that I normally thematize the other as an object when empathizing. Emphasize that the other, rather than being given to me simply as a nucleus of experiences, is given as a center of orientation.  The other is given as intentional, as directed at the same world as I, and the other's world. The meaning the world has for the other affects the meaning it has for me. My own perspective on the world will be enriched through my empathic understanding of the other.</p>
<p>I can be part of what the other intends. I experience them as subjects who experience worldly objects, myself included.</p>
<p>Empathy can function as an important source of self-knowledge.</p>
<p>I am not what I am for myself, independently of the other; nor is the other independent of me. Everybody is for himself and at the same time for the other in an inseparable being-for-one-another.</p>
<h2 id="schutz">Schutz</h2>
<p>While he recognizes the fundamental and irreducible character of the face-to-face encounter, at the same time he emphasizes the heterogeneity异质性 of interpersonal understanding. (variety and complexity)</p>
<p>The body of the other is no mere physical object but a field of expression that reveals the experiential life of the other. External behavior of the other indicates his subjective experiences, or it may refer to the fact that the subject 'is deliberately seeking to express something' by acting in a certain way.</p>
<p>Surface attitudes with the why of such feelings.</p>
<p>Not sufficient simply to observe expressive movements and actions. Also rely on interpretation, and draw on a highly structured context of meaning.</p>
<ul>
<li>rely on imagination, memory ,or theoretical knowledge.</li>
<li>face-to-face encounter: we-relationship, a shared motivational context; our understanding of the given context.</li>
<li>conversation; ask for an explanation</li>
</ul>
<p>Thou-orientation: general thesis of the other self; other-orientation; the other is bodily co-present and immediately given as a psychophysical unity. Directed at the living reality of the other; with an awareness of the presence of the other, but not with any specific awareness of what is going on in the other's mind.  -&gt; real life: with their own personal characteristics and traits.</p>
<p>I'm also able to understand and interact with whose whom I have previously encountered face to face but who now live abroad. -&gt; multilayered character of the social world.</p>
<p>They-orientation: no direct expressive movements or acts, my understanding is always general in form, shaped and framed by structures of typicality. Conceive as a type and leave individual characteristic.  Close friends: assume they remain homogeneous and stay the same.  (habitual ideal types) -&gt; Typificaiton (and stereotyping) consequently facilitates everyday predictability.</p>
<p>The ideal types we acquire become part of our stock of knowledge and start to influence our face-to-face interactions as well. (as interpretative schemes)</p>
<h2 id="the-phenomenological-proposal">The phenomenological proposal</h2>
<ul>
<li>Some conceive of empathy as a sharing of mental states, where sharing is taken to mean that the empathizer and the target must have roughly the same type of mental state. Empathy does not involve knowledge about the other. It doesn't require knowing the other has the mental state. Contagion and mimicry.</li>
<li>Some argue that empathy requires both sharing and knowing. There is not only a match between the mental state of th empathizer and the target. Must cognitively assign or ascribe the mental state to the target. Self-other differentiation.</li>
<li>Some emphasize the cognitive dimension, and argue that empathy doesn't require sharing. Refer to any process one comes to know the other's mental state.</li>
</ul>
<p>Affectivity condition, interpersonal similarity relation condition, causal path condition, ascription condition, caring condition.</p>
<p>But still limitations.</p>
<p>Empathy requires a prior understanding of the other's mental life in order to get off the ground, and is then supposed to allow for an enhanced understanding of the other's feeling.</p>
<p>The phenomenologist claim that empathy involves a simulation-plus-projection routine. Deny that empathy is a projective process that centrally involves either the imaginative adaptation of another's point of view or at least some form of inner imitation.</p>
<p>The fact that you are feeling a very different emotion doesn't make it any less a case of empathy.</p>
<p>Empathy is one-sided.</p>
<p>It's possible to empathized with the cognitive, affective and conative experiences of the other, with beliefs, perceptions, feelings, passions, etc.</p>
<p>One can't empathize with unowned experiences.</p>
<p>Empathy takes different forms, has different stage or levels.</p>
