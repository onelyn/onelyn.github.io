                <p>Empathy definitions have varied in subsuming cognitive processes, behavioral components, and other-focused intentions.</p>
<p>Constructs related to empathy such as sympathy, empathic concern, personal distress, perspective taking, and emotional contagion.</p>
<p>Empathy is currently best thought of as a process centered on affect matching, that this process can be affected by cognitive factors, and that it should not be confused with other constructs.</p>
<hr>
<p>Ancient greed roots of the word: <em>empatheia</em>, can be divided into &quot;en&quot; (in) and &quot;pathos&quot; (feeling), clearly prioritize the affective basis of the term.</p>
<p>Theodor Lipps' original contributions: coined the term <em>Einfuhlung</em>, which can be translated as &quot;feeling into&quot;.</p>
<p>-&gt; an affective process</p>
<p>The phenomenon of empathy is challenging to isolate because there are so many related and overlapping processes.</p>
<p>Best: prioritized a process of affect matching.</p>
<p>Additionally, the importance of maintaining a self-other distinction is necessary to separate empathy from other constructs. This self-other distinction is maintained by most prominent empathy theorists. It's the continuous process of the empathizer to match his/her emotional state to another that can best separate empathy from constructs.</p>
<p><strong>It is important to acknowledge that the other is the actual source of the felt emotion</strong>, simply co-experiencing the emotion is not enough. The simultaneous experience of the same emotion by two persons can arise from different mechanisms.</p>
<p>Conceptualization: <strong>a shared affective state elicited by another, while still maintaining a self-other distinction and source of the emotion</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Definitional variability for empathy:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although often referred to as a unitary construct, empathy is now commonly embraced as multi-dimensional. It's generally accepted to have an affective component and a mechanism for monitoring and maintaining a distinction between self and other. Many other definitions include a cognitive component but vary in the necessity, the role and the type of cognitive processes involved in empathy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The importance of self-other awareness</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most contemporary definitions of empathy involve the process of affect matching, but additionally require an awareness and maintenance of a self-other distinction.</p>
<p>If that component is included, then empathy can be defined more as a broad category of emotional responding than as a discrete不连续的, measurable, construct.</p>
<p>The distinction has important implications for whether the empathizer engages in prosocial or egoistic behavioral responding.</p>
<p>Emotional contagion: the tendency to automatically mimic and synchronize facial expressions, vocalizations, postures, and movements with those of another person and consequently to converge emotionally. (doesn't necessitate self-other awareness)</p>
<p>Mimicry: no self-other and no affective state but require behavioral response</p>
<p>Sympathy: the heightened awareness of the suffering of another person as something to be alleviated. (negative emotions, doesn't require an isomorphic同形的 affective state, a motivation to act)</p>
<p>Compassion: the feeling that arises in witnessing another's suffering and that motivates a subsequent desire to help. (negative emotions, doesn't require an isomorphic affective state, a motivation to act)</p>
<p>Perspective taking: the ability to consciously put oneself into the mind of another individual and imagine what that person is thinking or feeling. (no affective state, require cognitive component)</p>
<p>Empathic concern: other-oriented emotion elicited by and congruent with the perceived welfare of someone in need. (negative emotions, doesn't require an isomorphic affective state, a motivation to act)</p>
<p>Personal distress: a self-oriented, aversive emotional reaction such as anxiety or discomfort. (self-oriented, affective state)</p>
<p>Theory of mind: the cognitive capacity to attribute mental states to self and others. (no affective state, cognitive component)</p>
<p>Basic monitoring of the origins of emotions as arising from oneself or the interacting &quot;other&quot; is essential to separate empathy. A more complex understanding of the boundaries between self and other likely does no develop until about 1-2 years of age. More complicated emotion understanding and the ability to take perspectives of others do not develop for a few years after.</p>
<p>Empathy needs to develop over time and true empathy with self-other distinction is not an inborn ability.</p>
<p>The right inferior parietal cortex is commonly noted as a region in a larger network of brain structures that serves a role in distinguishing the self from other. (Exp: whether the participant believed the observed action was performed by themselves or by the experimenter)</p>
<h2 id="role-of-emotion-regulation">Role of emotion regulation</h2>
<p>Emotion regulation varies in what it encompasses.</p>
<p>&quot;The ability to respond to the ongoing demands of experience with a range of emotions in a manner that is socially tolerable and sufficiently flexible to permit spontaneous reactions as needed.&quot;</p>
<p>It is a frequently recruited process to maintain empathy. Emotion regulation can aid and facilitate the empathic process.</p>
<p>From a developmental perspective, effortful control, defined as &quot;the ability to inhibit a dominant response to perform a sub-dominant response&quot;, is a temperament that has been demonstrated to have individual differences across the developmental spectrum. It is usually reflected through effortful attentional regulation and inhibitory control. Children high in effortful control tend to experience empathic concern instead of personal distress. This capability is contigent on individual differences in development in which emotional arousal and then emotion understanding must develop before regulatory strategies such as effortful control come online.</p>
<p>Less noted is the role of the target's emotion regulation. The target could regulate their emotion state to vary the matching. The empathic response may diminish levels of distress in the target (interpersonal).</p>
<p>Note when the regulation occurs in the emotion regulation -- empathy interaction. Emotions can be generated and then regulated at many different stages. Empathy appears to often be a product of appraisal processes that are either fast and implicit or more controlled and voluntary. The emotional cue (or and the emotional context together, there are two models) can elicit an appraisal process which can modulate the emotional response.  -&gt; automatic vs controlled long be proposed. All in all, regulatory processes can serve in determining when, or if, a person elicits an empathic response.</p>
<p>Lastly, the <em>goal</em> which emotion regulation is employed for is an important point to keep in consideration. Effective emotion regulation serves to allot more time to outward-focused emotion states of others and less to one's own emotion state.</p>
<h2 id="separation-of-conflated-constructs">Separation of conflated constructs</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Emotional contagion and mimicry</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Affective information is transmitted from one person to another.</p>
<p>Emotional contagion can be understood as one's tendency to &quot;catch&quot; another's emotional state.</p>
<p>Conceptualized as &quot;primitive empathy&quot;, and is the most primitive form of emotion sharing.</p>
<p>Includes elements of automatic information transference via mimicking expressions witch purportedly leads to an emotional convergence with the other.</p>
<p>Appears early in human development. Infants mimic to cry.</p>
<p>Vis a perception: action link. Or via the mirror neuron system.</p>
<p>The most responsible mechanism: automatic mimicry. Mimicry is an unconscious imitation of another's behaviors without any insight to the purpose of their actions. Mimicry can take place in many forms, while the majority of research focus on facial expressions.</p>
<p>Mimicry develops early in life. Mimicry has been suggested to serve as a quick, low energy-requiring, apprehension of the interacting person's affective state.</p>
<p>Facial mimicry can occur when the mimicker does not necessarily experience the same subjective emotional experience, and varies across different social contexts. It's suggested by some that mimicry has only a small role in emotional contagion and is more important for promoting affiliation goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facial feedback</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inform the expresser that they are experiencing a particular emotion. Adopting a facial configuration of a given emotion is theorized to produce afferent传入的 feedback that is distinct to the adopted configuration, thus eliciting or strengthening the subjective experience of the given emotion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mimicry and emotion transference</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The interpersonal mimicry of facial expressions should influence the affective state of the receiving person to match the sender. Facial EMG studies have often shown that mimicry in response to facial expressions, even if presented at a sub-conscious duration, will induce contagion of the corresponding emotion.</p>
<p>The level of mimicry varies with each participants' reported empathy.</p>
<p>Others have argued against the universality of emotion expressions and consequently, that the emotional contagion will not necessarily be isomorphic to emotion expressed by their partner.</p>
<p>But since muscles of the cheeks and mouth are recruited for the display of most basic emotion expression, this does not preclude the experience or expression of any of these emotions simply because the patterned muscular contraction is being recruited for speech purposes.</p>
<p>Not all mimicry is based upon facial configurations.</p>
<p>However, some moods, such as sadness, appear to attenuate the presence of facial mimicry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Emotional contagion &amp; mimicry via simulation theory</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simulations theories account for how emotions can be quickly transmitted between interacting persons.</p>
<p>The observation of a behavior automatically activates the same neural pathways and subjective experience that performing the same behavior does. -&gt; Mirror neurons</p>
<p>But it is too simple to explain the complex empathy. Moreover, the simulation theories of empathy also do not always require a maintenance of self-other distinction which is a requisite component that separates empathy from simple emotional contagion.</p>
<p>Although emotional contagion and mimicry can serve roles in the origination or maintenance of empathy, they should not be considered as essential aspects of the phenomenon. Empathy and empathy-like stated can be induced via perspective taking, and empathy requires a self-other maintenance., so they are not sufficient to fulfill the empathy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cognitive processes in empathy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cognitive processes can initiate empathy. This can happen via active perspective taking, or via empathy. Mere elicitation of an emotion will regularly be accompanied by associated thoughts.</p>
<p>Cognition can be used to sustain empathy. This can manifest as cognitive strategies to regulate uncomfortable emotion states by processes such as intentional emotion suppression, cognitive reappraisal or attentional distraction.</p>
<p>Hoffman's model: hierarchy of empathy-related cognitive processes. Q: what degree, what type of roles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cognitive empathy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stress the importance of cognition in empathy. Two perspectives to explain: the <em>simulation</em> and <em>the theory of mind</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>simulation: the empathizer imagines another's state as though it was their own; to understand; mirror neuron and action-perception models</li>
<li>theory of mind: a process of attributing an independent mental state to another, and through a continual employment of rule sets, trying to best predict the other;s thoughts, emotions, and behaviors; related with perspective taking (the ability to imagine and feel from another's perspective by putting oneself into their mind)</li>
</ul>
<p>Damage to the medial PFC led to a preservation of empathic ability but a deficit in cognitive flexibility, while damage to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) has been linked to impairment in empathic ability but maintenance of cognitive flexibility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is cognition essential in empathy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cognition has important roles in many facets related to initiating and sustaining empathy but does not have an essential role in empathy. Affective other-oriented emotion processes can take place without complex online cognitive processes such as perspective taking.</p>
<p>Cognition <em>can</em> serve for empathy but is <em>not required</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Empathic concern</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Defined as an &quot;other-oriented emotion elicited by, and congruent with, the perceived welfare of someone in need&quot;.</p>
<p>Can be studied experimentally. is often conceptualized within the Empathy-Altruism利他 Hypothesis (EAH) (a motivation to help that target, an ultimate focus on benefiting another individual even behavior may also benefit the helper).</p>
<p>Prosocial behavior can be motivated by personal distress. This motivation is theorized to be self-focused and egoistic.</p>
<p>Individuals are able to and likely do simultaneously feel both empathic concern and personal distress in a given circumstance. So whether thy have an altruistic/egoistic motivation depends on the relative strengths of the two.</p>
<p>Induce empathic concern: imagine the perspective of the target in need / prompt participants to value the target in need.</p>
<p>High levels of empathic concern - help more (even in the easy-escape condition)</p>
<p>Low empathic concern but if helping would fulfill their self-focused desire to alleviate personal distress: help (difficult-escape condition)</p>
<p>-&gt; 3 vs 1</p>
<p>A framework assessing empathic concern as an individual difference variable. IRI - four sub-scales -&gt; links between empathic concern score and prosocial behaviors score.</p>
<p>However, it can be difficult to parse out self-focused from other-focused motivations. Prosocial behavior may be the effect of self-focused motivations. Reduce: anonymous无意识到的 prosocial behavior</p>
<p>Differences between empathic concern vs. empathy: Empathy can be felt with both positive and negative emotions || Empathic concern only with negative emotions and perhaps particularly with sadness. Empathy is neither ultimately other- nor self-focused. Empathy is not necessarily connected to prosocial behavior. || Empathic concern is other-focused and can be either an antecedent or consequence of personal distress. (but sometimes they experience empathic concern but can't help)</p>
<p>What caused the confusion: the words are similar; the lead of previous researchers</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Enter sympathy and compassion</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sympathy can be defined as an &quot;affinity倾向性, association, or relationship between persons or things wherein whatever affects one similarly affects the other&quot;. Definitions vary in languages.</p>
<p>English - an other-focused concern || Italian - a kind of valence-free无价 emotional connection between individuals</p>
<p>Compassion: pleasant/both pleasant and unpleasant (argue)</p>
<ul>
<li>sym-: having the like or same form || com-: together with</li>
<li>-pathy: suffering || -passion: suffering</li>
</ul>
<p>Compassion is a process that includes <em>noticing, feeling, and responding</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>noticing: recognition and awareness (conscious, cognitive awareness, unconscious affective responses)</li>
<li>feeling: an experience of sympathy towards the individual under awareness</li>
<li>responding: a desire to help</li>
</ul>
<p>There are similarities between compassion, sympathy, empathy and are not acknowledged.</p>
<p>A new conceptualization added to compassion: understanding the universality of suffering; tolerance of uncomfortable emotions.</p>
<p>Explicit focus on others' suffering, only consistent with conceptualizations of compassion as unpleasant.</p>
<p>Compassion can be thought of as a multi-stage process that effectively includes sympathy.</p>
<p>However, others assess compassion as a single construct, often with self-report measures.</p>
<p>Empathy: somewhat similar to feeling || Compassion: somewhat similar to responding as well as to prosocial behavior</p>
<p>If we are correct that empathic concern and sympathy represent the same underlying construct, the compassion likely also assessed this same underlying construct.  -&gt; be referred to as &quot;sympathy&quot;</p>
<p>Neither of these constructs are empathy(individual's continuous process of the matching his/her emotional state to that of another)</p>
<p>=&gt; empathy | sympathy &amp; valid conceptualizations</p>
<h2 id="empathy-sympathy-and-pain-paradigms">Empathy, Sympathy, And Pain Paradigms</h2>
<p>Empathy for pain: coordination of activity in brain areas for experience/observe -&gt; &quot;pain matrix&quot; (supplementary motor area SMA, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ACC, anterior midcingulate cortex aMCC, anterior insula AI, periaqueductal gray PAG)</p>
<p>But also respond to other stimuli perceived to be unpleasant and salient -&gt; a response to aversive反感的 stimuli</p>
<p>Singer 2004: (women) ACC and AI activity was correlated with sympathy scores.</p>
<p>Decety 2010: assess for both empathy and sympathy; observe photographs of individuals accidentally causing pain to themselves/being intentionally inflicted with pain by others -&gt; empathy/sympathy &amp;&amp; empathy pain condition was associated with activity in the pain matrix while sympathy not.</p>
<p>Moving right if the figure move right: not an emotional stimuli but about empathy (feeling into). If the same direction- empathy (see from the other's perspective and move in the same) | If the opposite direction-sympathy(mirror the other's behavior but from own perspective).</p>
<p>Although these indirect measures may represent the best current way to assess empathy, the researchers who use them need to take an extra theoretical step to link them directly to empathy.</p>
<p>Empathic distress, like personal distress, can lead to prosocial behavior under specific circumstances. However, it is more associated with self-focused behavior that will efficiently alleviate the observer's own suffering. Empathic concern/sympathy and sympathetic distress instead focus on helping the other that extends beyond any benefit that is accrued by the self.</p>
<p>Empathic self-efficacy reflects the individual's beliefs in their ability to share the affective state of another. Such individuals could be more likely to enter into situations where empathy would be expected.</p>
<h2 id="empathy-and-positive-emotions">Empathy and Positive Emotions</h2>
<p>Empathy: affect matching, do not exclude empathy for positive emotions.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: individuals who were induced to experience high levels of empathic concern, but who were randomly assigned to the 20% and 80% percent conditions, would be less likely to read the follow-up -&gt; would predict the target would either improve/not improve based on their randomly assigned likelihood.</p>
<p>empathy towards positive emotions = positive empathy</p>
<p>Negative but not positive empathy was associated with activity in regions that had been previously linked to empathy. The past studies exploring the brain imaging of empathy had mostly focused on negative emotion states or pain inductions.</p>
<p>Different induction methods affected the results.</p>
<p>Measure facial muscle movements to assess underlying emotions and emotional contagion: relevant muscle activity (zygomatic activity in the happiness trials and corrugator in the sadness trials) predicted prosocial behavior in only one trial for each condition (not the average of conditions).</p>
<p>Individuals react to and potentially engage in other-oriented emotion states with both positive and negative emotions.</p>
<p>Positive and negative empathy were correlated. These could represent different facets of empathy and not completely separable constructs.</p>
<p><strong>Empathy is foremost an affective process, albeit one than can be moderated by cognitive factors. Empathy requires a distinction between the boundaries of self and other. Empathy can be experienced towards any emotion, regardless of valence. Researchers should take care to use clear and consistent language when discussing empathy and related topics.</strong></p>
<p>PS.</p>
<p>Empathy research can be interpreted as being consistent with basic emotion theory, which states that humans evolved capabilities to recognize and express specific (basic) emotions. In order for individuals to engage in affect matching (empathy), they would have to reliably produce emotional signals, that could be accurately perceived by observers. New theories: (reject basis emotion theory) individuals not reliably producing or interpreting emotion signals that are specific to discrete emotions.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion!</h2>
<p><strong>Empathy involves a shared affective state while a self-other distinction is maintained. Cognitive elements are not essential.</strong></p>
