                <p>different images are presented to each eye at the same spatial location: the visual system resolve this conflict through binocular rivalry, that is, observers consciously perceive spontaneous alternations between the two images.</p>
<p><strong>between neural representations visual attention is generally important</strong></p>
<p><em>IMPORTANT</em> -&gt; <em><strong>NECESSARY</strong></em>   that is what the author discovered: when attention was diverted away, rivalry stopped. AND the neural representations of the dichoptic images combined without attention (?)</p>
<ul>
<li>Meng, M., and Tong, F. (2004). Can attention selectively bias bistable perception? Differences between binocular rivalry and ambiguous ﬁgures. J. Vis. 4, 539–551.</li>
</ul>
<p>Binocular rivalry was strongly influenced by bottom-up factors such as changes in contrast or fixation position, but only weakly modulated by top-down selective attention. In contrast, perception of the Necker cube was much more strongly modulated by selective attention than by shifts in fixation position.</p>
<hr>
<p>feature of sustained binocular rivalry: the apparently spontaneous nature of perceptual switching</p>
<p><strong>Effortful attempts to CONTROL rivalry (e.g. pay more attention to one percept in order to prevent its alternating with the rival percept) fail during sustained rivalry.</strong></p>
<p>-&gt; IS CONTROLLING RIVALRY AUTOMATIC? INDEPENDENT OF ATTENTION?</p>
<p>If observers do not attend to the rivalrous stimuli, do rivalry alternations still occur? (When a tree falls in a forest without a listener, is there a sound?)</p>
<p>-&gt; How the visual system processes conflicting information presented at an unattended spatial location?</p>
<p>LOGIC: if binocular rivalry is an automatic process that does not require attention, even an unattended stimuli should rival. OTHERWISE attention is necessary.</p>
<p>How to address: without attention, subjects can't directly report its perceptual status. -&gt; INFER the state of the visual system from brain signals.</p>
<p>EEG: frequency-tagging, method of multiple stimuli; track the cortical signal driven by each eye's stimulus; <em>the two stimuli were modulated(<strong>tagged</strong>) at different temporal frequencies (so you can track each eye's contribution to the steady-state visual evoked potentials, SSVEPs).</em></p>
<p>Binocular rivalry(previous study has found that characteristic): if the image in one eye becomes dominant, its cortical signal gains strength and the signal corresponding to the other eye weakens.  -&gt; WHETHER THIS MARKER OF RIVALRY REMAINS PRESENT WHEN ATTENTION IS DIVERTED AWAY</p>
<hr>
<p>a pair of incompatible checkboard - one to each eye - a mirror stereoscope</p>
<p>reversed their contrast at different temporal frequencies (red - 7.5 Hz, green - 6.6 Hz)</p>
<p>use EEG: only six posterior channels for analysis</p>
<p>fixated a central mark - monitored the parafoveal rivalrous stimuli - report perception by button presses (mean dominance duration = 2.45 s, standard deviation = 1.3 s)</p>
<p><strong>incompatible:</strong> the state in which two or more people are unable to interact harmoniously with each other.</p>
<p><strong>parafoveal:</strong>   Adjacent to or surrounding the fovea of the retina; of or relating to the parafoveal. 副凹处理对于信息获取和眼球运动控制的重要性一直是实验性阅读研究的最重要课题之一。大量研究表明，读者在固定一个单词的同时，通常会对下一个副凹的可用单词的开头字母（有时是所有字母）进行预处理。</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>unattended rivalry condition</strong>: ignore the rivalrous stimuli and performed a demanding <em>color-shape</em> conjunction task at fixation</li>
<li><strong>replay conditions(attended/unattended replay condition)</strong>: monocular checkerboards physically alternated, creating the perceptual alternations that mimicked those recorded in the attended rivalry condition, and the same two tasks directed attention either toward or away from the checkerboards</li>
<li><strong>attended condition</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>An small elliptical patch was simultaneously presented at fixation (subjects were instructed to fixate their eye on the center of the ellipse). Every second, the color of the ellipse was randomly set to red or gray (equal probability), and independently the orientation of the ellipse was set to either horizontal (fat) or vertical (thin), each also with equal probability. In the attended rivalry and attended replay conditions, subjects fixated on the ellipse but directed their attention to the checkerboard stimuli. In the unattended rivalry and unattended replay conditions, subjects ignored the parafoveal checkerboards and performed a color-shape conjunction detection task on the central ellipse. They were instructed to press a button when they detected a horizontal (fat) red or a vertical (thin) gray ellipse, and withheld their responses to the other two combinations (vertical red and horizontal gray ellipses). The temporal frequency of the ellipse’s color change was independent and very different from the flickering frequencies of the checkerboards.</p>
<p>first use a surface Laplacian spatial filter to minimize common noise</p>
<p><em>The Laplacian is a 2-D isotropic measure of the 2nd spatial derivative of an image. The Laplacian of an image highlights regions of rapid intensity change and is therefore often used for edge detection (see zero crossing edge detectors). The Laplacian is often applied to an image that has first been smoothed with something approximating a Gaussian smoothing filter in order to reduce its sensitivity to noise, and hence the two variants will be described together here. The operator normally takes a single graylevel image as input and produces another graylevel image as output</em></p>
<p><strong>an adaptive recursive least-square (RLS) filter used to extract the amplitude of the two frequency-tagged signals</strong></p>
<p>RLS: an adaptive filter algorithm that recursively finds the coefficients that minimize a weighted linear least squares cost function relating to the input signals. This approach is in contrast to other algorithms such as the least mean squares (LMS) that aim to reduce the mean square error.</p>
<p>最小二乘有个问题，就是前面计算出最优估计量后，当有新的数据进来时候，又要重新计算最优估计量。数据量比较大的时候，计算量会变得特别大。</p>
<p>所以引出了递归最小二乘，当有新的数据进来，不会再把以前的数据重新计算一遍，而是用当前的观测值对以前的最优估计量进行矫正更新。</p>
<p>最小二乘：拟合问题</p>
<p><u>read the material</u></p>
<p>The amplitude was calculated by minimizing the squared error between the input signal and predicted response within a 1.2 second window, and adaptively updated by sliding the window point by point over time. The first 2.4 seconds of the amplitude data were excluded to avoid the start-up transient of the adaptive filter.</p>
<p>result: sustained rivalry requires attention and is either greatly <em>reduced</em> or <em>does not occur</em> at all in the absence of attention</p>
<ul>
<li>when the observer attended to the checkerboard stimuli: the amplitudes were in a <em>counterphase</em> relationship - one rose the other fell</li>
<li>when unattended: <em>fluctuated</em> randomly without a systematic relationship between them</li>
<li>in the replay condition(the stimuli were physically alternating): <em>modulated in counterphase</em>, regardless of whether attention was on the stimulus</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>epoch: a progress that uses all data in the training set to finish a complete training</p>
<p>batch: refer to the part of data that is used to have a update of model</p>
<p>iteration: a progress that uses data of one batch to update the model</p>
<p>2 A: epoch - unit in second; break the time course into 6 epochs; drawn is the average curve; you choose all the peaks and troughs and view them as the center, then calculate as an epoch -tagged signal amplitude; another is drawn time-locked</p>
<p>peaks: identified as local maximum after it had been temporally smoothed by kernel - compute the average epochs</p>
<p>also analyze epochs centered on the rising phase or falling phase</p>
<ul>
<li>attended: counterphase, peak-to-trough</li>
<li>unattended: diminished rivalry</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>index of rivalry strength</strong>: dividing the amplitude of the counterphase modulation of the rival signal by the amplitude of the modulation of the aligned signal (amplitude: absolute value, the peak-trough difference in each phase condition and then average)</p>
<p>-&gt; a significant statistical interaction between types(replay/rivalry) and conditions(attended/unattended)</p>
<ul>
<li>rivalry: removing attention - reduce the index by almost a factor of four; when attention was focused on the conflicting stimuli the index reliably differed from zero</li>
<li>replay: attended/unattended comparable and both different from zero</li>
</ul>
<p><em>not dependent on finding peaks</em>: compute the <strong>Pearson's r correlation</strong> between the left and right eye frequency-tagged amplitude time course.</p>
<ul>
<li>attended rivalry/replay and unattended replay: strong negative</li>
<li>unattended rivalry: almost to zero</li>
</ul>
<p>皮尔森相关系数也称皮尔森积矩相关系数(Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient) ，是一种线性相关系数，是最常用的一种相关系数。记为r，用来反映两个变量X和Y的线性相关程度，r值介于-1到1之间，绝对值越大表明相关性越强。 协方差/两个标准差的积</p>
<p>how to explain the reason why index in the unattended rivalry condition was not statistically different from zero: not attributed to generally weak EEG signal - actually stronger than the unattended replay condition (the counterphase modulation was already detectable)</p>
<p>not zero, but any small counterphase modulation that might have been present was likely due to some residual attention paid to the rivalry stimuli</p>
<p>post hoc 事后 subjective reports - largely but not completely unaware</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>So WHAT IS THE STATE OF THE VISUAL SYSTEM when presented with unattended conflicting dichoptic signals</strong></p>
<p><em>Dichoptic is viewing a separate and independent field by each eye</em></p>
<ul>
<li>post hoc subjective reports
<ul>
<li>uncertain about the nature of percepts in the unattended situation - confirm the effectiveness of the attention manipulation</li>
<li>providing limited information about the state</li>
<li>In a pilot experiment, six naive subjects reported their perception of our original stimuli in the attended and unattended rivalry conditions. Five trials from each condition were run in an alternating sequence. When all trials were finished, a questionnaire was given to the subjects.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-&gt; uncertainty: adopt the frequency-tagged SSVEP measure (steady-state visual evoked potential)</p>
<p>(did suggest that perceptual alternations were greatly reduced when attention was withdrawn)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The reduced counterphase modulation could have been due to dramatically slowed rivalry of the two eyes' signals</p>
<ul>
<li>if so, one signal will stay much stronger than the other for prolonged durations.</li>
<li>not observed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>also could be because the two eyes' signals engaged in patchwise rivalry: two signals rivaled piecemeal, with local perceptual alternations not synchronized across space</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or because the two eyes' signals stayed in a fusion-like state: combined without one suppressing the other</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>in both 2 and 3, the two eyes' signals are concurrently processed in the visual pathways and thus have ample opportunity to interact with each other (e.g. as simultaneous input to binocular neurons or through lateral interactions between monocular neurons)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>visual system: nonlinearities (e.g. half- or full-wave rectification)</p>
<p>Full-wave rectification rectifies the negative component of the input voltage to a positive voltage, then converts it into DC (pulse current) utilizing a diode bridge configuration. In contrast, half-wave rectification removes just the negative voltage component using a single diode before converting to DC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>such interactions should produce energy in a series of nonlinear intermodulation frequency components whose frequencies are <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo>×</mo><mi>f</mi><mn>1</mn><mo>±</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>×</mo><mi>f</mi><mn>2</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m\times f1 \pm n\times f2</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.66666em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">m</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span><span class="mbin">×</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span><span class="mord">1</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span><span class="mbin">±</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.66666em;vertical-align:-0.08333em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">n</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span><span class="mbin">×</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.2222222222222222em;"></span></span><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.8888799999999999em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault" style="margin-right:0.10764em;">f</span><span class="mord">2</span></span></span></span>, where <span class="katex"><span class="katex-mathml"><math><semantics><mrow><mi>m</mi><mo separator="true">,</mo><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">m, n</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class="katex-html" aria-hidden="true"><span class="base"><span class="strut" style="height:0.625em;vertical-align:-0.19444em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">m</span><span class="mpunct">,</span><span class="mspace" style="margin-right:0.16666666666666666em;"></span><span class="mord mathdefault">n</span></span></span></span> are positive integers.</p>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>in our data: found substantial power at the intermodulation frequencies in the rivalry conditions (means the two eyes' signals have the potential to interact in cortex), but not in the two replay conditions (presented separately in time without the opportunity to interact)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in attended rivalry condition, found greater intermodulation power during the transitions between reported dominance periods (a time during which patchwise rivalry and fusion are expected to occur) than during the dominance periods themselves</p>
<ul>
<li>reported dominance period: actually the transition period</li>
<li>dominance periods themselves: stable phase</li>
<li>see figure S 3</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The power of the intermodulation frequencies was significantly stronger in the unattended rivalry condition -&gt; strong interaction between the two eyes' signals -&gt; combination of the two eyes' signals in the visual cortex when attention is withdrawn.</p>
<p><em>Power Spectrum Analysis For each condition, EEG signals from the 12 trials were first averaged in the time domain, then Fourier transformed to the frequency domain. To compare the overall power of the harmonic frequencies with the power of intermodulation frequencies, the power of the first three harmonics (f1, f2, 2f1, 2f2, 3f1, 3f2) was summed into a single power value, and the power of five intermodulation terms (3f1-f2, f1+f2, 4f1-f2, 2f1+f2, 2f2+f1) was similarly summed.</em></p>
<p>The difference between conditions was not simply due to greater overall power during unattended rivalry: in contrast to the intermodulation frequencies, the power of the harmonic frequencies was significantly weaker in the unattended conditions both rivalry and replay, <em>consistent with a previous study of attentional effects on the SSVEP</em></p>
<ul>
<li>The amplitude of the frequency-coded SSVEP elicited by either of the task-irrelevant flickering backgrounds was significantly enlarged when attention was focused upon the character sequence at the same location. This amplitude enhancement with attention was most prominent over occipital-temporal scalp areas of the right cerebral hemisphere regardless of the visual field of stimulation. These findings indicate that the SSVEP reflects an enhancement of neural responses to all stimuli that fall within the &quot;spotlight&quot; of spatial attention, whether or not the stimuli are task-relevant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reasons for stronger interaction:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>patchwise rivalry:</p>
<p>intermodulation terms could arise from neurons with large receptive field in later visual areas that integrate responses from adjacent临近的 patches with different dominant frequencies</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>lateral interactions between neurons responding to adjacent patches</p>
<ul>
<li>The influence of signals generated by retinal neurons on the activity of other neurons laterally distant in the retina.</li>
<li>Lateral interactions in the outer retina, particularly negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones and direct feed-forward input from horizontal cells to bipolar cells, play a number of important roles in early visual processing, such as generating center-surround receptive fields that enhance spatial discrimination</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>rivalry ceased without attention, and the two eyes' signals were locally combined by binocular neurons in early visual areas, resulting in a neural state similar to that produced by perceptual fusion.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-&gt; evaluate the likelihood (acknowledging that other accounts could still exist): exp 2 to simulate them and examine whether the simulation produced a power distribution resembling the observed one</p>
<hr>
<p>the relative power of the intermodulation frequencies: stronger in fusion than in patchwise</p>
<p>because the binocular contrast reversal in the fusion condition was a stronger physical stimulus than the locally monocular contrast reversal, the fusion generated slightly more power overall for some subjects</p>
<p>-&gt; correct: normalized - the intermodulation normalized by the summed power of the harmonics --&gt; still better in fusion (in patchwise some similar with noise level)</p>
<p><strong>fusion &amp; unattended rivalry condition: resembled in terms of frequency and the strength of power</strong></p>
<p>Exp 3: use high-density (128 channels instead of 64) EEG</p>
<ul>
<li>energy is mainly present at posterior electrodes, shows a clear peak for the eye's signal that was used to select peaks and demonstrates the characteristic counterphase modulation in the other eye's signal</li>
<li>same result: only unattended rivalry condition doesn't have that</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Source localization analysis</strong> on the high-density recordings revealed that the scalp topographies could be accounted for by one major source near the medial occipital枕叶 pole with small contributions from two bilateral两侧 occipital sources. These locations <strong>near visual areas V1 and hMT+</strong> had been identified as sources of the EEG signal in conditions similar to the SSVEP produced by medium frequency contrast reversal of a simple pattern (ours).</p>
<p><em>when localization, we don't use a Laplacian spatial filter because it removes much of the spatial information required for source localization, so minimized noise using phase-aligned averaging</em></p>
<p><em>did not expect a single common location to provide the strongest measure of the frequency-tagged EEG, so for each subject, use as a reference location, the electrode at or adjacent to the occipital pole with highest SNR(signal-noise ratio); then extract the amplitude of the frequency-tagged signal at that electrode</em></p>
<ul>
<li>the contribution from the two bilateral (near hMT+) is relatively minor</li>
<li>a single source near V1 explained over 93% of the variance, the three-dipole solution explained over 95%</li>
<li>reconstruction, PCA, all show the well-explanation as temporal modulations</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Also known as the striate cortex, or simply V1, the primary visual cortex is located in the most posterior portion of the brain's occipital lobe . In fact, a large part of the primary visual cortex cannot be seen from the outside of the brain, because this cortex lies on either side of the calcarine fissure.</em></p>
<p><em>hMT+: V5</em></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>when subjects attended to competing, dichoptic stimuli, their conscious perception spontaneously alternated between the two stimuli - one dominant and the other fall, this counterphase modulation is a physiological marker for binocular rivalry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>when attention was withdrawn from the competing stimuli, the marker disappeared: binocular rivalry requires visual attention</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>source localization on the SSVEP topographies shows a dominant source form medial occipital lobe (V1/V2) near the posterior pole and minor contributing sources from bilateral areas near MT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ALL IN ALL, <strong>attention is necessary</strong> to resolve the interocular conflict in early stages of visual processing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>previous studies found that attention could determine the initial dominance, modulate the temporal dynamics of binocular rivalry to some degree and enhance the strength of suppressed signals, <strong>but it remained unknown whether binocular rivalry could occur at all when attention was strongly diverted</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>previous: subjects were allowed to attend to the stimuli during brief intervals interspersed with longer periods of unattended rivalry (limited sampling condition) -&gt; infer that perceptual alternation significantly slowed down or even stabilized (rivalry may not occur)</li>
<li>our: attention was continuously diverted from the competing stimuli</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>a previous fMRI study: observe a propagating wave of binocular rivalry resolution even when attention was diverted; the nature of the dynamic change in V1 BOLD signal was ambiguous and could have arisen from other neural events besides the resolution of rivalry</p>
<ul>
<li>using similar stimuli, a more recent fMRI study from the same group failed to find evidence of interocular suppression with dichoptic stimuli when unattended</li>
<li>V1 BOLD signal change likely reflected a cross-orientation suppression rather than binocular rivalry</li>
<li>frequency-tagging makes identify signals originating from each eye easy</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>unattended conflicting dichoptic stimuli produced large amplitudes at intermodulation frequencies, more consistent with the neural state produced by binocular fusion than patchwise rivalry</p>
<ul>
<li>interpretation: without attention, rivalry ceases, and the two eyes' signals locally combine in the visual cortex</li>
<li>possible mechanism: orientation tuning may broaden without attention, with the consequence being that cells become more permissive in the orientation domain
<ul>
<li>orientation tuning: Neurons in visual cortex are selective for the orientation of a visual stimulus, while the receptive fields of their thalamic input are circular. Cortical orientation selectivity arises from the organization of both thalamic input and local cortical circuits.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>In sum, binocular rivalry, seemingly automatic, is in fact highly dependent on attention.</strong></p>
<p>attention may be required to bind features together into an object, perhaps by biasing and resolving competition in neurons between features that belong to different objects.</p>
<ul>
<li>The hypothesis is that locating and binding the features requires retrieval of their connections to the master map of locations. To put what and where together, an attention window moves within the location map and selects from the feature maps whatever features are currently linked to the attended location, temporarily excluding the features of all other objects from the object perception level. The attended features can then be entered, without risk of binding errors, into the currently</li>
<li>Treisman, A. (1998). Feature binding, attention and object perception. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 353, 1295–1306. (cited 900)</li>
<li>The hypothesis outlined in this chapter about the role of attention in binding appears to conflict with Duncan's view of attention as integrated competition between objects (Desimone &amp; Duncan 1995; Duncan, this issue; see also Bundesen, this issue). In Duncan's language, attention is a state into which the system settles through global competition between objects for dominance over experience and action, rather than a selective process that helps create those objects. He denies the need for any external selective mechanism.</li>
<li><em>However, for the features of the same object to cooperate in competition with others and to benefit from each other's ascendancy in the competition, it seems as though they would already need to be bound. Duncan's suggestion is that binding is achieved through detectors directly coding conjunctions of pairs of attributes. An alternative is that the competition postulated in Duncan's framework could arise at a later level than the binding mechanism proposed here, and could have evolved to determine selection for the control of actions. Attention need not be a unitary process simply because a single word is used in everyday language.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>attention is similarly required to resolve competition between features arising from different eyes. Without attention, the competition between feature appears to be suspended, with binocular neurons being driven by feature from both eyes.</p>

<p>We also found differential effects of attention on wave propagation in those different retinotopic maps; in V2 and V3, but not in V1, the fMRI responses signifying cortical waves were eliminated (or reversed direction in V3) when attention was diverted from the rival stimuli.</p>
