<p>It's not clear to what extent the aging brain is capable of such plasticity.</p>
<p>3 MRI-based measurements: arterial spin动脉瓣 labeling MRI,functional connectivity, diffusion扩散 tensor张力 imaging.</p>
<p>3 time points: pre, mid, and post training (12 weeks)</p>
<p>randomized sample n=37</p>
<p>-&gt; training-related brain state changes at rest</p>
<ul>
<li>increases in <strong>global and regional cerebral blood flow (CBF)</strong>, particularly in the <strong>default mode network and the central executive network</strong></li>
<li>greater <strong>connectivity</strong> in these same networks</li>
<li>increased <strong>white matter integrity</strong> in the left uncinate钩状的 demonstrated by an increase in fractional anisotropy各向异性</li>
</ul>
<p>propose:</p>
<p><em>cognitive training enhances resting-state neural activity and connectivity, increasing the blood supply to these regions via neurovascular神经血管 couping.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Age-related brain losses are represented in structural shrinkage, loss of white matter integrity, reduced functional connectivity, preferentially affecting frontal and temporal networks.</p>
<p>The mechanisms of brain plasticity (functional and structural changes) that support cognitive gains with training remain poorly understood.</p>
<p>Strategy-based cognitive training may have a beneficial impact on preventing and potentially reversing age-related brain decline.</p>
<p>This investigation addressed whether neuroimaging methodologies方法论 of <strong>resting-state</strong> brain mechanisms could be utilized to characterize coherent连贯的 patterns of brain change following cognitive training.</p>
<p><em>Assessment of training-induced brain alterations at rest is informative given that the brain's resting energy needs are much greater than task-evoked neural activity</em></p>
<p><em>Resting-state studies reportedly have 3 times the signal to noise ratio with task-based activation studies.</em></p>
<p>Evidence seems to suggest that a higher level of resting connectivity across different brain networks and CBF may be associated with higher cognitive performance.</p>
<p>And maybe there's other energy-consuming neural components such as increased concentration of neurotransmitter receptors, greater rate of turn over of cellular细胞 proteins, enzymes酶, member lipids脂质, and greater axoplasmic轴浆 transport.</p>
<p><strong>Propose: Complex cognitive training would result in higher CBF and functional connectivity, in 2 separate but coordinated brain networks, central executive network (CEN) and default mode network (DMN) as well as related structural changes in cognitively healthy older adults.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And the correspondence between significant brain blood flow and cognitive changes.</strong></p>
<h2 id="materials-and-methods">Materials and Methods</h2>
<p><strong>Participants:</strong></p>
<p>37 cognitively normal adults  -&gt; randomized to 2 different groups: <u>wait-list</u> control and cognitive training.</p>
<p><strong>Complex Cognitive Training Program:</strong></p>
<p>Gist要点 reasoning: a strategy-based rather than content specific and entailing使..必需 a systematic use of 3 cognitive processes including strategic attention, integrated综合的 reasoning and innovation to process all types of data.</p>
<p>Involving top-down cognitive control of complex information that is maintained, manipulated and synthesized综合 into abstracted meanings.</p>
<p>Cognitive control processes entailed in <strong>gist reasoning</strong> have been associated with frontal lobe networks and nodes within both the CEN and DMN.</p>
<p>The program trained individuals to <strong>continually synthesize meanings and goals</strong> integral to information encountered in everyday life across a multitude of contents, and involved practice of <strong>innovative thinking</strong> by generating diverse interpretations as well as a wide variety of ways to approach or solve a task at hand.</p>
<p><em>Training also in daily life to gain a habit of thinking.</em></p>
<p><em>One 1-h session per week (12 weeks) and 2 additional 1-h sessions per week without supervision at home (12 weeks).</em></p>
<p><strong>MRI Acquisition:</strong></p>
<p>Use different MRI techniques to investigate changes at rest:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>pCASL三维伪连续动脉自旋标记  sequence to measure CBF</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>fcMRI  to assess functional connectivity of the brain</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>DTI MRI to assess structural connectivity between brain regions via white matter tracts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>T1-weighted image as an anatomical解剖的 reference</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MR Data Processing:</strong></p>
<p>pCASL image series were realigned重新编制 to the first volume for motion correction.</p>
<p>MATLAB to calculate the difference between averaged control and label images.</p>
<p>The difference image was corrected for imaging slice delay time to yield CBF-weight image.</p>
<p>The whole-brain blood flow values were calculated by averaging all the voxels in the brain.</p>
<p><em>In voxel-based analyses, the individual CBF maps were spatially smoothed to account for small differences in sulci/gyri location across subjects. For cluster extent inference, control false-positive activation clusters over the set of all activation clusters throughout the whole-brain volume. For cluster inference, test the volume of clusters which is conditional on 2 criteria: smoothness of the voxel map and cluster-defining threshold.</em></p>
<p>Each region's signal time course was band-pass filtered to keep only the appropriate frequency fluctuations波动. Both white matter and cerebrospinal fluid signals were regressed out using averaged signals from the white matter and the ventricles for each ROI.</p>
<p><strong>Neurocognitive Measures:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>baseline/pretrainig</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>midtraining week 6</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>at end of training week 12</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Assessment of changes in trained functions included 3 randomized versions of the Test of Strategic Learning (TOSL) to measure the ability to synthesize global meanings: to abstract gist meanings from complex input.</p>
<p>Measurements of untrained cognitive functions included tests of executive function(WM, &quot;Trails B-Trails A&quot; switching), memory, and complex attention(Color Word Interference selective attention).</p>
<p><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>linear model to assess the contribution of cognitive training on neurocognitive, CBF, functional connectivity, and structural connectivity measures.</p>
<p>Including the interaction between factors.</p>
<p>Two variance components: variability across subjects, variability in th same subject over time.</p>
<p>residual剩余的 maximum likelihood.</p>
<p>Hypothesize: the cognitive training group would show an increase in mean measures (except Trails B-Trails A, since RT should be lower), either by T2 or T3, relative to the control group. -&gt; lead to 2 orthogonal垂直的 polynomial interaction contrasts:</p>
<ul>
<li>linear: test whether the mean change between the groups increased monotonically from T1 to T3</li>
<li>quadratic二次: test whether the mean change between groups increased maximally at T2 before decreasing at T3</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Neural Correlate Analysis:</strong></p>
<p>examine the relationship between the group mean change in voxel-wise CBF and the group mean change in neurocognitive measures</p>
<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<h3 id="mri-measurements">MRI Measurements</h3>
<p>CBF was measured by pCASL MRI in both control and cognitive groups.</p>
<p>The global CBF at T1 for both groups were similar.</p>
<p>The cognitive training group's global CBF increased by 7.9% from T1 to T2 and remained elevated at T3.</p>
<p>Voxel-wise analysis to test whether monotonically or peak at T2</p>
<p>The cognitive training group showed a significant increase in blood flow at T3 in left middle temporal, left superior medial, left inferior frontal gyri.</p>
<p>The cognitive training group showed a peak increase at T2 in the inferior temporal gyrus, precuneus楔前叶, and posterior cingulate扣带 gyrus回.</p>
<p>Both DMN and CEN networks have been identified as integrated functional hubs that mediate higher order cognitive control processes.</p>
<p>Functional connectivity increases over the training sessions, monotonically in the DMN and with a maximum increase at T2 in the CEN.</p>
<p>The functional connectivity changes in DMN and CEN mirrored the blood flow changes in the same regions.</p>
<p>The whole-brain functional connectivity of the cognitive training group did not show significant temporal changes.</p>
<p>Based on the monotonic blood flow increase in left middle temporal and left superior medial frontal gyri, identified the white matter structure connecting the 2 regions called left UF. The UF tract was delineated描绘 both manually and automatically.</p>
<ul>
<li>manual tractography method: the FA of left UF showed a monotonic increase, while FA of right UF showed no significant temporal changes</li>
<li>automatic tractography method: the FA of the left UF similarly showed a monotonic increase which signals better white matter integrity while the whole brain FA did not show significant differences</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="neurocognitive-measures">Neurocognitive Measures</h3>
<p>No significant differences in the baseline scores.</p>
<p>The cognitive training group significantly improved over time in 2 cognitive domains. The most complex cognitive domain, Strategic Reasoning (ability to synthesize generalized meanings from lengthy textual input) and a measure of Executive Function, Similarities (ability to abstract concepts) showed a significant monotonic increase.</p>
<h3 id="cbf-correlates-of-cognitive-changes">CBF Correlates of Cognitive Changes</h3>
<p>Correspond to mean changes in brain blood flow.</p>
<p>The significantly improved cognitive changes corresponded with increased regional brain plasticity as measured by blood flow increases at rest in specific brain-behavior patterns.</p>
<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>
<p><strong>Strategy-based cognitive training has the potential to reverse some of the negative consequences of age-related functional and structural brain losses.</strong></p>
<p><em>Training positively altered the intrinsic本身的 activity of the brain at rest as well as its structural connectivity.</em></p>
<h3 id="training-induced-brain-plasticity">Training-Induced Brain Plasticity</h3>
<ul>
<li>global/regional CBF</li>
<li>increased functional interdependence within brain networks</li>
<li>improved white matter integrity</li>
</ul>
<p>These significant increase support reversals in age-related declines as reflected by good agreement between increases in both CBF and greater functional connectivity in both the default mode and the central executive networks, and improvement in white matter integrity.</p>
<p>Propose that the cognitive training increased the overall cellular activity and metabolic新陈代谢 rate in certain brain regions included in 2 networks, the DMN and CEN.</p>
<p><em>higher metabolic demand, higher blood supply, etc.</em></p>
<h3 id="increases-in-global-cbf">Increases in Global CBF</h3>
<p>Complex cognitive training may serve to increase whole-brain blood flow in healthy older adults.</p>
<p>Resting CBF is consistent &amp; Regional CBF may increase or decrease during mental activation tasks due to redistribution of blood -&gt; return to baseline when the brain return to resting state.</p>
<p>A maintained increase in global CBF from T2 to T3, supporting the possibility of <strong>increasing resting whole-brain blood flow</strong> and achieving a new homeostasis体内平衡 level in the aging brain.</p>
<p><em>CBF could potentially become useful markers of treatment effects</em></p>
<p>Propose that greater connectivity and neural activity result in higher CBF.</p>
<h3 id="convergence-in-fc-and-resting-cbf">Convergence in FC and Resting CBF</h3>
<p><strong>Monotonic increases from T1 to T3 in FC</strong> that was mirrored in resting CBF of DMN's regions, posterior cingulate, and medial prefrontal cortices. This increasing pattern in the DMN suggests that the potential benefit of training did not plateau within the time period of study.</p>
<p>The CEN's connectivity change was mirrored in its regional CBF, dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal cortices, and is a <strong>peak increase at T2</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The increases in connectivity and CBF at T2 do not return to baseline by T3.</strong></p>
<p>-&gt; mean that the training had a large onset effect, which then reached plateau or may even have slightly settled down, which happens when the neuronal changes are consolidated巩固 (eg. forming new synapses rather than firing at higher frequency using existing synapses).</p>
<p><em>DMN finding is found in young adults following WM training but CEN isn't.</em></p>
<p>(may due to differences in the nature of the cognitive training, delineation描述 of network nodes since these are currently undergoing refinement精致)</p>
<h3 id="convergence-of-regional-cbf-and-structural-connectivity">Convergence of Regional CBF and Structural Connectivity</h3>
<p>In the concomitant伴随的 improvements in the left middle temporal and left superior medial frontal resting CBF and FA of left UF, which connects these 2 regions.</p>
<p>Higher FA has been associated with higher white matter integrity as water molecules分子 diffuse more anisotropically非均质地 along the axonal轴突 fibers.</p>
<p>Healthy older adults have reduced FA in the intracortical projecting fiber tracts such as UF, and it is associated with age-related cognitive decline.</p>
<p><strong>The loss of white matter tracts may be reversible with strategy-based cognitive training.</strong></p>
<p>The structural changes on DTI emerged later at T3.</p>
<p>Neurophysiologic plasticity is followed by structural plasticity occurring concomitantly with acquisition of new skills within a few weeks of cognitive training.</p>
<p>Functional brain changes are more frequent and rapid than structural plasticity.</p>
<p><em>functional-&gt;structural-&gt;cognitive</em></p>
<h3 id="cognitive-plasticity-and-cbf-correlates">Cognitive Plasticity and CBF Correlates</h3>
<p>Synthesized thinking is related to cognitive control measures purported to activate the PF networks included within the CEN and DMN; further complex strategy-based training generalizes to untrained cognitive control</p>
<p>Complex mental training may facilitate parallel gains in regional blood flow and cognition in older adults.</p>
<p>-&gt; brain-cognition relationship</p>
<p>Synthesizing abstracted and original meanings and conceptual integration have been previously linked to nodes of the CEN, but heretofore training-induced changes have not been examined according to parallel changes in both CBF and cognition.</p>
<p>Propose that cognitively challenging application of strategies to improve information processing is supported by intrinsic brain mechanisms &amp; mental exercise can bring about significant positive changes modifying brain systems</p>
<h3 id="plausible-mechanisms-of-brain-plasticity">Plausible Mechanisms of Brain Plasticity</h3>
<p>Demonstrated that functional connectivity/CBF changes in CEN occurred more rapidly emerging at T2 and DMN increased continuously over time with greatest increases observed at T3.</p>
<p>Suggest that CBF may be a more sensitive marker as the changes are detected globally whereas diffusion and functional connectivity measures only showed regional effects.</p>
<p>The cognitive training targeted the CEN but may also have impacted the DMN. The increases in connectivity and CBF in CEN did not return to baseline level suggests that the gains were relatively stable.</p>
<p>Speculate that the cognitive training regime would leave a &quot;footprint&quot; on the resting brain such that greater resting-state spontaneous neural activity occurs in DMN and CEN regions. This increased activity is manifested as greater functional connectivity. Because of neurotransmitter receptors' aggregations聚集 the footprint is still present, preparing the brain to react better for future stimulus of similar type even at resting state.</p>
<p>Protein and lipid脂质 syntheses in the neuron may also be enhanced, serving to form/strengthen new synapses if the trained habits are maintained for a substantial period of time.</p>
<p>All of these will cost energy, manifested as greater blood supply to these brain regions. And maybe accompanied by white matter changes such as increased myelin thickness.</p>
<h3 id="limitations-to-current-findings">Limitations to Current Findings</h3>
<ul>
<li>small sample size -&gt; previous study</li>
<li>the potential for nonresponse bias due to missing data from those whose MRI data had to be excluded due to missing MRI scans or excessive movement -&gt; compare between the subjects with and without MRI scans in the training group and found the nonresponse bias could only reduce the magnitude of finding rather than inflating them.</li>
<li>lack of an active control group -&gt; randomized trial study, couldn't be accounted form simply by active stimulation alone</li>
<li>A longer post labeling delay time may be useful in alleviating the possible limitation.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conclusions-and-future-directions">Conclusions and Future Directions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Complex mental activity induces broad-based changes in brain function and structure.</li>
<li>The training-dependent brain changes were likely achieved by top-down strategy-based stimulation that are believed to activate large-scale brain circuitry that work interdependently within widely distributed brain regions.</li>
<li>The cognitive training involved considerable usage of lengthy language-based materials as well as rich visual stimuli where participants were required to construct novel and abstract interpretation. This processing  required complex top-down information processing, implicating multiple brain regions within the DMN and CEN.</li>
<li>Functional connectivity and CBF increased, and the specific white matter tract connecting certain regions was enhanced.</li>
