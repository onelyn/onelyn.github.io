<p>tone frequency learning -&gt; improve ability to discriminate fine differences in tone frequency</p>
<ul>
<li>learn a general task structure: can transfer to new frequencies</li>
<li>changes in neural representations of trained frequencies or re-weight frequency-specific neural responses: significant frequency specificity</li>
</ul>
<p>hypotheses: frequency specificity in tone frequency learning can be abolished with a double-training procedure</p>
<p>exp 1: practice tone frequency discrimination at 1 or 6 KHz, presumably encoded by different temporal or place coding mechanisms respectively -&gt; specificity</p>
<p>exp 2: double-training, with additional exposure to the other untrained frequency via an irrelevant temporal interval discrimination task or even background play during a visual task -&gt; transfer</p>
<p>=&gt; general task structure learning or concept learning.</p>
<p>irrelevant: the secondary training alone would have no significant impact on the primary training task.</p>
<p>in exp 2 participants practiced tone frequency discrimination at 6 and received exposure to 1 via performing a temporal-interval discrimination task in alternating blocks of trials. (6 to 1)</p>
<p>(Another group only practiced temporal-interval discrimination at 1 between pre- and post-training tests)</p>
<p>exp 3: 1 to 6</p>
<p>exp 4: How does DT enable learning transfer?</p>
<p>One possibility is that the training and exposure induce temporal coupling between 1 and 6.</p>
<p>So another group practiced 1 and 6 task in two separate training phases.</p>
<ul>
<li>the facilitation may require learning either before or at the same time: a group perform reverse double training</li>
<li>no transfer to a third frequency without exposure: tested at a third frequency</li>
</ul>
<p>But found that the transfer is not a result of stimulus temporal coupling between them. (Sequential also enables it)</p>
<p>The other two are right.</p>
<p><strong>General Discussion:</strong></p>
<p>The frequently observed specificity in perceptual learning has often been interpreted as an indication of permanent neuronal plasticity in early, low-level stages of cortical processing. However, recent researches emphasize the decisive roles of high-level brain areas.</p>
<p>Tone frequency learning is special in the sense that whether and how much it is specific to the trained frequency depends on the stimulus configurations. For example, learning with longer continuous tones tends be mostly transferrable to a new frequency, but learning with brief tone pips tends to show more specificity. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that even the strong specificity with brief tone pips can be completely removed with double training, in exactly the same manner as demonstrated in visual perceptual learning. Therefore, tone frequency learning, regardless of the training stimuli and the initially observed specificity, at its core is a high-level cognitive process.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that double training would induce plasticity in the primary auditory cortex at both the trained and transfer frequencies.  Although our data cannot rule out low-level plasticity at the trained frequency, improved frequency discrimination at the transfer frequency has to rely on response reweighting through high-level processes. This is because the transfer frequency per se is not trained with frequency discrimination,and the control experiments show that training with a temporal interval discrimination task (the transfer frequency exposure task) alone has minimal impact on frequency discrimination at the same frequency.</p>
<p>Moreover, the reweighting function of responses at the transfer frequency may not be remapped from the trained frequency directly.</p>
<p>the participants are learning a conceptual representation of tone frequency, which is similar to a concept-learning account we proposed in visual perceptual learning</p>
<p>However, whether learning can actually transfer depends on the functional connections between high-level learning and new sensory puts. Exposure to new sensory inputs in double training helps establish these functional connections to enable transfer.</p>
<h2 id="complete-transfer-of-perceptual-learning-across-retinal-locations-enabled-by-dt">Complete Transfer of Perceptual Learning across Retinal Locations Enabled by DT</h2>
<p>Perceptual learning of many tasks is found to be retinal location specific.</p>
<p>This location specificity is interpreted as a pointer to a retinotopic early visual cortical locus of learning.</p>
<p>hypothesis: learning to discriminate a specific stimulus feature, and learning to deal with stimulus-nonspecific factors like local noise at the stimulus location (feature learning and location learning) -&gt; learning is not transferable to a new location</p>
<p>exp: conventional feature training at one location,  additional training with an irrelevant feature at a second location either simultaneously or different-timely</p>
<p>-&gt; additional location training enabled a complete transfer of feature learning to the second location</p>
<p>=&gt; cortical retinotopy as central concepts; perceptual learning involve higher non-retinotopic brain areas that enable location transfer</p>
<p>Most studies on the neural mechanisms of perceptual learning have focused on response changes in the retinotopic early visual cortex, as motivated by the often observed strict location specificity and the inferred retinotopy. The complete transfer of perceptual learning to new retinal locations revealed by DT calls into question both location specificity as a key property of visual perceptual learning and the well-received belief by many researchers that the retinotopic early visual cortex is the neuronal basis of perceptual learning. Rather, it points to a crucial role for non-retinotopic higher brain areas that engage attention and decision making for perceptual learning.</p>
<p>Motion-direction learning is correlated with activity changes in a decision area LIP but not the sensory area MT, and orientation learning is more correlated to changes in V4 rather than V1 but are too small to fully account for behavioral orientation learning =&gt; brain areas higher than V4 must have involved.</p>
<p>High brain areas including the intraparietal sulcus, frontal eye field, and supplementary eye field participate in visual perceptual leaning.</p>
<p>Central learning can guide visual discrimination at a new location. Location learning is stimulus feature/task nonspecific. Hypothesize that location learning improves spatial attention. Our everyday experience is probably insufficient as location training in the visual periphery for demanding visual discrimination tasks near their thresholds. Spatial attentions excludes unwanted noise without affecting the stimulus template. If the stimulus template learned through feature training is stored in a central site, it would now be able to respond to the same stimulus at a new retinal location where noise has been excluded through location training.</p>
<p>Complex stimuli are typically not presented in a single retinal location so their learning is presumably nonspecific to retinal locations and occurs in higher brain areas. But perceptual leaning of basic visual features also involved higher brain areas.</p>
<h2 id="dt-downshifts-the-threshold-vs-noise-contrast-functions-with-perceptual-learning-and-transfer">DT downshifts the threshold vs. noise contrast functions with perceptual learning and transfer</h2>
<p>Location specific perceptual learning can transfer to a new location if the new location is trained with a secondary task that by itself does not impact the performance of the primary learning task.</p>
<p>DT with an external noise paradigm, measure the Vernier thresholds at various external noise contrasts before and after DT.</p>
<p>-&gt; DT mainly vertically downshifts the TvC functions at the training and transfer locations, interpreted as improved sampling efficiency in a linear amplifier model or a combination of internal noise reduction and external noise exclusion in a perceptual template model.</p>
<p>The change of TvC functions appears to be a high-level process than can be remapped from a training location to a new location after DT.</p>
<p>Threshold for performing a certain visual task are measured with the target stimuli presented in external noise of various contrasts. The contrast threshold plotted against the noise contrast in log-log axes is called a threshold vs. noise contrast function.</p>
<p><em>TvC: to infer properties of the underlying perceptual process, which is presumably limited by the presence of various internal noise sources affecting perceptual sensitivity. By titrating the signal with the external noise, one can make inferences about how these internal noise sources affect sensory perception. When the relationship between the level of external noise and perceptual thresholds is measure and plotted in log-log coordinates, the resulting curve shows distinctive features, where the thresholds remain constant over the low external noise levels and then increase linearly as a function of external noise after a certain level of external noise. This curve is called the TvC curve.</em></p>
<p>The study results show that training led to a vertical downshift of the TvC functions at the training location. Moreover, equally downshift with learning transfer after DT, indicating that similar learning mechanisms underlie learning and transfer.</p>
<p>Vernier游标 threshold: one-interval staircase.</p>
<p>Orientation discrimination threshold: two-interval forced-choice staircase</p>
<p>Perceptual learning may operate at an abstract conceptual level. Maybe:</p>
<ul>
<li>better match the trained stimulus feature to a feature concept</li>
<li>conceptual process that not only reduce internal noises but also exclude external noises</li>
</ul>
<p>Vernier thresholds were pretested at all five noise contrasts - mixed results: The vertical downshift at the transfer location was not significant but with large individual differences. mixed results from pre-training and DT.</p>
<h2 id="perceptual-learning-of-vernier-discrimination-transfers-from-high-to-zero-noise-after-double-training">Perceptual learning of Vernier discrimination transfers from high to zero noise after double training</h2>
<p>Perceptual learning is more than template learning, in that more abstract statistical rules may have been learned, so that learning can transfer to stimuli at different precisions.</p>
<p>Perceptual learning of Vernier discrimination at high noise, which has thresholds approximately 10 times as much as those at zero noise, is initially non-transferrable to zero noise. However, additional exposure to a noise-free Vernier-forming Gabor, which is ineffective alone, not only maximizes zero-noise fine Vernier discrimination, but also further enhances high-noise Vernier performance.</p>
<p>Such high-threshold coarse Vernier training cannot impact the fine stimulus template directly.</p>
<p>-&gt; the observers have learned the statistical rules that can apply to standardized input distributions to improve discrimination, regardless of the original precision of these distributions.</p>
<p>Perceptual learning of discriminating a visual feature imbedded in zero external noise, such as orientation, motion direction, or binocular disparity双眼视差, can transfer to discrimination of the same feature imbedded in high external noise. However, learning of feature discrimination at high noise transfers much less or little to the same feature at zero noise.</p>
<p>Hypothesize: observers with feature discrimination training at both zero and high noise may learn the same rules of reweighting stimulus inputs, regardless of the dramatically different thresholds required for stimulus discrimination. The observers learn to reweight standardized stimulus inputs, so that feature learning standardized stimulus inputs, so that feature learning obtained at one noise level is in principle transferrable to a different noise level.</p>
<p>DT: the primary training task - Vernier training at high external noise</p>
<p>the secondary training task - orientation discrimination training with a noise-free Gabor, a pair of which would form the Vernier stimulus</p>
<p>=&gt;</p>
<p>Perceptual learning is more than learning of rigid stimulus templates. The rules of reweighting the sensory inputs are learned that treat stimulus signals at zero and high noise equally even if the thresholds could be very different. Be done through standardization of the distributions of visual inputs at different noise levels.</p>
<p>A precise stimulus template, regardless of where it is stored, would not predict coarse-to-fine learning transfer. The post-training Vernier thresholds at high noise were still many times as high as those at zero noise, so learning with coarse Vernier could hardly improve the fine stimulus template.</p>
<p>The two-way transfer suggests that the plasticity may occur in brain areas that are untied to fine or coarse stimulus features.</p>
<h2 id="task-relevancy-and-demand-modulate-dt-enabled-transfer-of-perceptual-learning">Task relevancy and demand modulate DT enabled transfer of perceptual learning</h2>
<p>Found that location training with an irrelevant task limited transfer of Vernier learning to the trained orientation only. However, performing a relevant suprathreshold orthogonal Vernier task prompted additional transfer to an untrained orthogonal orientation. In addition, the amount of learning transfer may depend on the demand of location training as well as the DT procedure.</p>
<p>fMRI: the site of perceptual learning may be located in the human medial front cortex, which is also the site of perceptual decision making.</p>
<p>Hypothesis: a high-level decision unit learns the rules for performing a visual task through training. However, the learned rules cannot be applied to a new location or orientation automatically because the decision unit cannot functionally connect to the visual inputs representing the new location or orientation with sufficient strength. Attention is allocated to the trained location or orientation and not inputs representing the new location. DT reactivate these new inputs so that the functional connections can be strengthened.</p>
<p>task relevance and demand of location training:</p>
<p>passive stimulus exposure/irrelevant/relevant; passive stimulus exposure/suprathreshold/near-threshold</p>
<p>Vernier learning: strictly specific to the trained location</p>
<p>Baseline: feature training plus passive exposure to stimuli at the transfer location =&gt; mere passive exposure to the stimuli at the transfer location cannot replace active location training to override the specificity of Vernier learning.</p>
<p>DT: feature training plus location training with an irrelevant suprathreshold task =&gt; transfer of learning was specific to the trained orientation under the current DT conditions, the transfer was partial.</p>
<p>DT: feature training plus location training with a relevant suprathreshold task =&gt; complete transfer in a sequential DT but only partial transfer in a simultaneous DT</p>
<p>DT: feature training plus location training with an irrelevant but demanding near-threshold task =&gt; same orientation specificity</p>
<p>Active location training is indeed necessary to enable learning transfer across retinal locations. If location training is task-irrelevant, learning transfer may be limited to the trained feature orientation only. However, a relevant suprathreshold task at the untrained orientation is sufficient to expand transfer to an untrained orientation, even at the trained location. -&gt; orientation specificity can be decoupled from perceptual learning by a primer at a different retinal location. Also, learning transferred to a diagonal quadrant in the untrained visual hemifield, rather than to the other quadrant in the same hemifield.</p>
<p>contrast to TPE(training plus exposure) training, which shows that foveal learning of orientation discrimination and contrast discrimination can completely transfer to an orthogonal orientation passively exposed to in an irrelevant task. -&gt; transfer of peripheral learning in the current study to an orthogonal orientation in the diagonal quadrant involves one extra step of functional connection.</p>
<p>Transfer may already be complete in sequential procedures even with much less demanding suprathreshold location training tasks. -&gt; further investigation, maybe simultaneous DT the reactivation by a suprathreshold location training task is not strong enough to fully remove the suppression of attention</p>
<h2 id="the-transfer-of-motion-direction-learning-to-an-opposite-direction-enabled-by-dt">The transfer of motion direction learning to an opposite direction enabled by DT</h2>
<p>Perceptual learning of motion-direction discrimination is specific to the trained direction and can transfer significantly and sometimes completely to an opposite direction, provided that the observers receive additional exposure of the opposite direction via an irrelevant task.</p>
<h2 id="vernier-learning-with-short-and-long-staircase-training-and-its-transfer-to-a-new-location-with-dt">Vernier learning with short- and long-staircase training and its transfer to a new location with DT</h2>
<p>The first experiment confirmed the transfer effects with short-staircase Vernier training. The second revealed that long-staircase training only produced very fast learning at the beginning of the pretraining session but with no further learning afterward. Moreover, the learning and transfer effects differed insignificantly with a small effect size, so it's difficult to claim that learning with long-staircase training cannot transfer to an untrained retinal location.</p>
<p>piggybacking effect: peripheral vernier learning in one retinal quadrant, which is highly location specific, can be piggybacked to other untrained retinal quadrants when vernier training is paired with orientation-discrimination training at the same location.</p>
<p>single long staircase: ~800 trials</p>
<p>multiple short staircases: 10 reversals and approximately 50~60 trials each</p>
<p>Exp 1: short-staircase training -&gt; learned and transfered with DT</p>
<p>Exp 2: long-staircase training -&gt; Vernier learning occurred mainly from the first to the second staircases in the pretraining session (fast learning) then no further improvement throughout the training course. The effect size of the location main effect was small.</p>
<p>First-staircase vs. geometric means of five to six staircases</p>
<p>Argue that first-staircase threshold calculation results in more variable estimations with smaller effect sizes.</p>
<p>&quot;hard trials&quot; prevent perceptual learning in most observers.</p>
<p>the insignificance may be unrelated to the number of trials.</p>
<p>When the learning effect is small, it is hard to decide whether and how much learning transfers to a new location.</p>
<p><em>the difficulty of tasks</em></p>
