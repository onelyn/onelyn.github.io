<p>the plasticity of higher cognitive functions</p>
<h2 id="content">Content</h2>
<p>WM was first proposed to be the memory for plans of future action.</p>
<p>WM is important for complex abilities like learning and reasoning.</p>
<p>WM is associated with PFC and has neural correlates.</p>
<p>WM is &quot;the capacity to guide behavior by <strong>representation of stimuli</strong> rather than by the stimuli themselves&quot; -&gt; <strong>concepts and plans</strong> can govern behavior</p>
<p>limitation: the restricted amount of info</p>
<p>WM capacity differences are associated  with several important abilities.</p>
<p>clinical -&gt; lower WM capacity</p>
<p>traditionally assumption: WM capacity is an immutable不变的 individual characteristic</p>
<p>recently: can be increased by using computerized training and can transfer (performances)</p>
<p>reasoning not transfer &amp; attention transfer</p>
<p><em>Here focus mainly on visuospatial视空间 WM (most heavily studied)</em></p>
<p>consider the possibility that improved spatial coding in attention and WM is a key component</p>
<p><em>environment affects cognitive ability</em>  -&gt; development in childhood</p>
<p><em>Studies of WM in rodents啮齿动物</em></p>
<p><em>eight-arm radial半径 maze迷宫, info about the location visited needs to be remembered across consecutive choices. Lesions损伤 of the prelimbic region印前区, a part of the cortex suggested to be a homologue同系物 of the primate PFC impair performance. An alternative mechanism: transient短暂的  activation of populations of neurons that come 'online' at different time points in order to span the entirety of a delay period.</em></p>
<p><em>WM training has been shown to improve performance across a range of tasks in rodents. Such training induces long-lasting molecular分子的 changes, including chromatin染色体 remodeling and expression of immediate early genes, such as the gene encoding activity-regulated cytoskeleton细胞骨架-associated protein(ARC).</em></p>
<p><em>Increased prelimbic activity has generally been reported following various types of task learning that require WM. Training also results in enhanced dopamine D1 receptor-mediated neuronal activation in the prelimbic cortex.</em></p>
<h3 id="neural-basis-of-wm">Neural basis of WM</h3>
<p>macaque猕猴: remember the spatial location or identity of a stimulus over a delay period lasting for a few seconds</p>
<p>-&gt; <strong>single neurons in the PFC exhibit discharges that persist even after the physical stimuli that elicited引出 them are no longer present (persistent activity/delay activity)</strong></p>
<p>Thought to be generated by <strong>reverberating回响 discharges</strong> in a network of interconnected互联的 neurons in the PFC, and between the PFC and other brain areas (posterior parietal顶叶 and inferior temporal cortex), and subcortical structures (basal基底的 ganglia神经节 and the mediodorsal中嗅 nucleus of the thalamus丘脑)</p>
<p>Persistent activity in the PFC also predicts WM performance.  Near-linear relationship between PA and the ability to remember the correct stimulus.</p>
<p>Info that can be extracted from PFC neuron activity quickly reaches its maximum when more than one item is being remembered. The capacity limitation seems to be independent for the two hemifields of vision, mirroring human results that suggest relatively faster decay of WM performance for multiple items presented in the same hemifield as opposed to along the vertical meridian眼球垂直子午线. -&gt; <strong>Within-hemifield competition limits the ability to maintain WM for multiple objects.</strong></p>
<h3 id="computational-models-of-wm">Computational models of WM</h3>
<p>Biophysically realistic models of networks of neurons have been created in which persistent discharges are mediated by activity reverberating in the network through <strong>recurrent反复的 connections between neurons</strong></p>
<p><em><strong>A ‘ring’ model</strong></em> has been particularly fruitful in simulating persistent activity relating to visuospatial WM: each node in the network represents a neuron with the peak of its receptive field at a different location in a zone of the visual field at a constant distance from the fovea中央凹, forming a ring. The strength of connections between neurons in the model depends on the distance between their preferred locations in the visual field.</p>
<p>The activity peak, or ‘bump’, that represents the firing rate of the population of neurons survives the disappearance of the stimulus, but the location it represents drifts slowly in time from that of the original location of the stimulus. Greater drifts represent larger errors between the location represented by the persistent activity relative to the location represented by neuron activity during stimulus exposure.  Items can also be forgotten because overall inhibition in the network decreases the firing frequency (that is, eliminates the bumps), such that it is not high enough to maintain recurrent activity.</p>
<p><em><strong>Synaptic (as opposed to spiking) mechanisms</strong></em> are likely to mediate effects such as repetition suppression, in which a lower level of activity is observed for a previously presented stimulus. Repetition suppression, however, is limited to memory for repeated stimuli and could not play a part in other memory tasks such as those requiring a response towards a previously presented stimulus or reporting the identity of a remembered stimulus.</p>
<p>Another: through the <em><strong>dynamic pattern of activation</strong></em> of different neurons at each time point during a WM task.  Information about stimulus properties may also be present in the magnitude, frequency and phase of rhythmic activity during the WM interval</p>
<h4 id="computational-models-of-wm-capacity">Computational models of WM capacity</h4>
<p>the activity representing each of the stored items held in memory acts as a bump attractor</p>
<p>As more items are added to memory, the total population activity increases, as does the amount of activity of inhibitory interneurons in the system.</p>
<p>when the capacity of the system is exceeded, the persistent activity representing some of the stimuli decays because of the increased inhibition, and these stimuli cannot be recalled at the end of the delay period.</p>
<p>The PFC may represent stimulus content in WM, but another crucial function of the PFC is to provide a top-down signal that insulates隔离 stimulus-coding networks both in the PFC and in other areas that generate persistent activity, such as the posterior parietal cortex, from the mutually inhibitory effects of having multiple items stored in WM</p>
<p><strong>The concurrent activity of a population of neurons coding for several multi-featured items in a pattern that allows extraction提取 of stimulus properties may serve to store their attributes in memory</strong></p>
<p>Alternatively, a gain mechanism may represent different attributes of objects: <strong>single neurons exhibit tuning for one attribute, and their overall level of activity is modulated by a second attribute.</strong> The attributes of different items may be represented by the specific phase of spiking in a rhythmic code. The capacity is determined by the number of items that can be simultaneously represented at different phases of rhythmic activity.</p>
<p>Factors: The strength of synaptic interactions within and between stimulus-encoding networks, the strength of synaptic activity from a region providing excitatory input to a stimulus-encoding network, the extent of individual neurons to exhibit bistability双稳态 and the strength of NMDAR and dopamine D1 receptor activation.</p>
<p>activity decays more easily in networks with lower discharge rates.</p>
<h4 id="wm-and-capacity-in-the-human-brain">WM and capacity in the human brain</h4>
<p>the type of stimulus determines how wide range of areas across the brain are involved.</p>
<p>commonalities: there's activity in a fronto-parietal前顶叶 network of regions, with the frontal regions including the middle frontal gyrus脑回 and the caudal尾端 part of the superior frontal sulcus沟 (额上沟)</p>
<p>the intraparietal cortex and caudal superior frontal gyrus are particularly strongly activated in visuospatial WM tasks and in tasks requiring spatially selective attention.</p>
<p>use fMRI and BOLD to show brain activity</p>
<p>MEG and EEG: <strong>during the delay in WM tasks the activity of frontal regions becomes more synchronous with that in parietal regions.</strong>  successfully kept info ↑ &lt;=&gt;the degree of this synchronicity increases  // also high-frequency oscillatory activity during WM tasks.</p>
<p><em>but the BOLD signal used for decoding is sometimes independent of the sustained increase in BOLD activity during the delay. (non-spatial stimulus info like orientation or direction of motion). Both increases and decreases of the BOLD signal can be informative about the stimulus maintained in WM&lt; reflecting excitatory and suppressive responses to the orientation and motion of stimuli. And BOLD signal is also influenced by sustained neuromodulatory input.</em>  -&gt; EEG</p>
<p>Another question: the retinotopic视网膜 organization of neurons that exhibit delay activity during visuospatial WM tasks intervals can also be found in humans?  -&gt; at least observed in humans in both the parietal cortex and posterior PFC during performance of WM tasks -&gt; the spatial location of the items that are kept in WM can be reconstructed from the pattern of activation measured during the delay period in either parietal regions or posterior frontal regions.</p>
<p>**More-anterior parts of the PFC lack clear retinotopy视黄醇, indicating that they provide top-down excitatory input to more posterior regions without actually storing sensory info//albeit at an extremely small spatial scale and fMRI failed to extract its info. **</p>
<p>larger differences in polarity极性 during the WM delay relative to baseline were associated with higher capacity</p>
<p>Functional connectivity between cortical regions can be estimated by quantifying the covariance of activity between different brain regions during resting-state fMRI. The overall integration of connectivity was found to be positively correlated with WM capacity.  Moreover, the synchronicity at several frequencies between frontal, parietal and visual areas was reported to positively correlate with inter-individual differences in WM capacity,  as was the power of local oscillations, with a positive association most clearly seen for the gamma band.</p>
<p><em>BOLD: Concurrent electrophysiological and fMRI measurements show that the BOLD signal is related to both single-unit activity and local field potentials, but it responds to input and intracortical processing rather than pyramidal-cell锥体细胞 output activity. It is also possible that neuromodulation by noradrenaline去甲肾上腺素, dopamine or acetylcholine乙酰胆碱 could dominate the BOLD response. A decrease in the BOLD signal in a certain area is often interpreted as an increase in ‘efficiency’ of the area in performing its function (a narrower tuning curve would mean that the activity of fewer prefrontal or parietal neurons would be required to code a stimulus, and thus predict a smaller BOLD signal after training &lt;-&gt;  however, reveal that training is associated with an increase in prefrontal pyramidal-cell firing rate and a flattening of tuning curves//another: decrease in the number of neurons that perform a cognitive process)</em></p>
<p>The signal directly reflects the amount of time that a particular brain area is activated. If training leads to a 10% higher firing rate in the 5% of neurons that code the stimulus, and the BOLD signal is linearly related to average firing rate, we would expect a 0.5% increase in the BOLD signal with training. If the reaction time, and thereby the length of time that the stimulus is kept in working memory, simultaneously decreases by 15%, any effect of the firing rate on the BOLD signal is drowned out or reversed.</p>
<h3 id="wm-training">WM training</h3>
<p>Plasticity: enables the brain to adapt to environment changes like increases in sensory stimulation, sensory deprivation, environment enrichment, the encoding of memories of episodes and places, the learning of new habits and motor skills.</p>
<p>activation or suppression of genes, changes in the strength of synapses, changes in the number of dendritic spines, changes in the arborization of axons, changes in myelination.</p>
<p>Question: what evidence is there for the involvement of these plasticity mechanisms in the behavioral effects of WM training?</p>
<h4 id="wm-training-in-non-human-primates">WM training in non-human primates</h4>
<p>PFC neuron responses in monkeys</p>
<p>**an increase in the percentage of PFC neurons that are activated by the stimuli, an even greater increases in the percentage of neurons that exhibit persistent activity after the offset of the stimuli, an increase in the mean firing rate of the activated neurons, much larger populations of ventrolateral PFC  neurons are active during the delay period of the task after training. **</p>
<p>dorsolateral PFC neurons changes little.</p>
<p>decrease in the average neuronal selectivity for a stimulus, a decrease in the ability of a neuron to discriminate between stimuli and decreases in the amount of info that could be decoded from recordings from the entire PFC population.</p>
<p>consider: training in the WM task involved the initial presentation of the simple geometric stimuli at distinct locations rather than consisting of novel stimuli that the animals were trained to discriminate. -&gt; a large portion of neuronal activity after training represents factors that are not specific to the stimuli but are related to the rules and execution of the WM task. -&gt; the activity that is selective for the trained stimuli declines as a percentage of total neuronal activity.</p>
<p>**decreased variability of firing rate across trials. the level of across-trial correlation of neuronal discharges also declines. **-&gt; training results in improved representation of stimulus properties in the population of PFC neurons through mechanisms that are independent of firing rate and that may be invisible to fMRI</p>
<p>Examine neural responses to different stimuli and quantifying the info that could be decoded with a classifier: task-specific info is only weakly represented in the untrained PFC while stimulus-specific info can be reliably decoded. with training, <strong>a small population of PFC neurons becomes highly selective</strong>(at a single-neuron level) for the task and a larger population exhibits a modest degree of task-relevant information. After training, task-relevant info is present in the activity of neurons that are selective for shape info, often manifesting itself in relatively short time windows, in the midst of other large firing rate modulations that occurred during a trial. PFC neurons multiplex different types of info, some only appeared with training (representing task variables).</p>
<p>early and late phases of training: delay-period activity increased in the PFC during the course of training as performance improved.</p>
<p><em>still unknown of non-trained cognitive tasks</em></p>
<h4 id="wm-training-in-humans">WM training in humans</h4>
<p>Q: To what degree training can lead to new areas being activated or changes the activation of areas that were already activated before WM training?</p>
<p>Associated with quantitative changes in the activity of networks that are already activated during the WM task before training.</p>
<p>behavior changes: not learning a new behavior but gradual improvement by around 0.6 standard deviations of a capacity from its baseline.</p>
<p>**Both increases and decreases in task-related BOLD activity in different regions. **increase&lt;=&gt;higher firing rate/increase in the number of cells with delay activity</p>
<p>higher-frequency firing&lt;=&gt;higher capacity/more-stable representations</p>
<p>decreases&lt;=&gt;improvements in efficiency</p>
<p>but the relationship is not straightforward</p>
<p><em>fMRI: point to the areas of change but do not inform about the underlying cellular mechanisms</em></p>
<p>Association areas of the PFC and the parietal cortex, including the network of regions that are known to be associated with WM capacity. If this network is used by a wider range of WM tasks, the robust association of WM training with functional changes in this network could explain the transfer effects of training (a wide range of tasks rely on partly the same network of brain regions)</p>
<p>Certain regions(medial temporal lobe, instrumental in declarative memory)</p>
<p>is not involved in the training effect. Visual association areas also less differentially activated. -&gt; WM training induces a specific type of learning.</p>
<p>Increases in the activity of the striatum during WM tasks have been associated with improvement during training.  Striatal activity can predict the amount of transfer after training. WM-related activity in the striatum follows a nonlinear change during training: initial increase, later decrease.</p>
<h4 id="wm-training-and-connectivity">WM training and connectivity</h4>
<p>One study: adults were imaged at rest, before and after 6 weeks of practicing verbal WM tasks that required manipulation of the material held in WM. Connectivity in the fronto-parietal network increased after training.</p>
<p>Another: changes in functional connectivity were compared in one group of adults performing n-back WM training, with a control group training on tracking of multiple visual objects. Only in WM group there's an increase in functional connectivity(between the parietal cortex and a superior frontal region &amp; between the parietal cortex and the dorsolateral PFC)</p>
<p>Another: transcranial magnetic stimulation was applied over the parietal cortex, and the electrical response induced in other regions (regions functionally connected to the parietal cortex) was mapped. -&gt; <strong>WM training increased functional connectivity</strong> between the parietal and occipital areas and between parietal and frontal areas specifically in trials with higher WM loads.  Also improved in non-trained cognitive tasks. / interpreted the findings as being reflective not of permanent structural changes but rather of changes in oscillatory synchrony, possibly driven by changes in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory transmission. Or there were structural changes in connections that are specifically recruited for higher loads. (like a top-down excitatory input from the PFC to the parietal cortex)</p>
<p>Mechanisms could be <strong>a stronger synaptic connectivity</strong> between neurons or an activity-dependent increase in the myelination of the connecting axons. Increases of white-matter density in the parietal lobe after WM training.</p>
<p><strong>In conclusion</strong> stronger connections between cortical regions (particularly frontal and parietal regions) play a key part in improving WM with training.</p>
<p>Structural connectivity can be measured by magnetic resonance signal in white matter. Higher capacity, higher BOLD activity in the intraparietal, superior frontal and dorsolateral frontal regions. The strength of connectivity between the PFC and its cortical afferents is a crucial determinant of capacity, and also an important factor during the normal course of development of WM from childhood to adulthood.</p>
<h4 id="wm-training-and-dopamine">WM training and dopamine</h4>
<p>One study: investigated the effect of WM training on dopamine-receptor density b scanning participants with PET before and after WM training. In both scans, the density of D1Rs and D2Rs was mapped during rest with SCH 23390(a D1R antagonist对抗药) and raclopride (a D2R antagonist) respectively. Overall there was a decrease in density but this was best characterized as an inverted-U function in which the amount of change in receptor density was dependent on baseline receptor density.  -&gt; dopamine plays a role in improving the ability to maintain info in WM despite distractions.</p>
<p>Another PET study in humans focused on the dynamics of dopamine release during performance of a WM task. D2R occupancy was measured.  The WM-training group showed an increase in release of dopamine.</p>
<p><strong>Variability in the gene encoding dopamine transporter 1(DAT1, also SLC6A3), the presynaptic transporter of dopamine into the cell, can explain some variability in how much individuals improve during training.</strong></p>
<p>A single-nucleotide核苷酸 polymorphism多形态 in the coding region of ankyrin连结蛋白  repeat and protein kinase激酶  domain域-containing protein 1 (<em>激酶域1(ANKK1)基因</em>) was associated with a larger effect of training and with a lower density of dopamine D2Rs in the striatum.</p>
<p>Dopamine and the striatum play an important part in relative improvement with WM training.</p>
<h3 id="conclusions-and-future-directions">Conclusions and future directions</h3>
<p><em><strong>The most-consistent changes in brain activity after WM training to be related to activity-association areas of the frontal and parietal lobes (known to be key for WM capacity).</strong></em> Stronger inter-areal connectivity and increased synchronicity between the frontal and parietal lobes are associated with inter-individual differences in WM capacity and this connectivity is strengthened by training.</p>
<p><em><strong>Stronger functional connectivity leads to a higher firing rate in the parietal networks</strong></em> that code spatial info during the delay period of WM tasks.</p>
<p>A higher firing rate and stronger connectivity result in a greater stability of the networks coding the info held in WM.</p>
<p>The transfer from one trained task to a non-trained task is probably related to a shared reliance of such tasks on a fronto-parietal network.</p>
<p>The dopaminergic system is implicated in the effects of WM training. <em><strong>Variability in dopaminergic signaling-related genes may contribute to inter-individual differences in improvements. WM training changes dopamine release and dopamine receptor density.</strong></em> The implications of dopamine could partly be related to the role of the striatum (not necessarily retain info during WM trials but could facilitate cortical plasticity)</p>
<p>No consistent changes associated with WM training in the primary visual cortex or in the medial temporal lobe (as in declarative memory).</p>
<p><em>There may be some similarities with motor learning and implicit memory.</em></p>
<p>Further research will require research about the concept of WM itself. In the review we describe a model of visuospatial WM and persistent activity, with info coded in the spatial tuning of neurons. But there are probably several different neuronal mechanisms that could contribute to short-term retention of info, including short-term synaptic memory and oscillatory info representation.</p>
<p>And how to interpret findings of changes in the BOLD signal and changes in the pattern of neural activity during the delay? Whether there represent mechanisms of capacity. -&gt; Compare fMRI with EEG</p>
<p>Q: whether plasticity during cognitive training could be enhanced. /dopamine -&gt; medicine /</p>
<p>tDCS could enhance ?</p>
