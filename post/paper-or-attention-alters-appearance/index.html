                <p>psychophysical evidence: covert attention affects early vision (enhances contrast sensitivity and spatial resolution)</p>
<p>neuro-physiological evidence: attention increases the neuronal contrast sensitivity (contrast gain)</p>
<p>-&gt; attention changes stimulus appearance</p>
<p><em>They develop a psychophysical method to directly assess the phenomenological correlates of attention</em></p>
<p><strong>idea: attention alters appearance, it boosts the apparent stimulus contrast.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>too much info to process -&gt; visual attention to select</p>
<p>one means of granting priority: direct one's gaze towards the relevant location || some situations need to attend to an area in the periphery like driving</p>
<p>the impact of covert attention in perceptual tasks: visual search, letter identification, contrast sensitivity, spatial resolution</p>
<p><strong>attention modulation occurs as early as striate and extra-striate visual cortex</strong></p>
<p>one type of covert attention: <strong>transient attention</strong>, stimulus-driven, reflexive capture of attention by an abrupt, salient peripheral cue.</p>
<p>explanation of how attention improves performance: the deployment of attention affects processing at the decisional level / attention actually enhances perceptual sensitivity.</p>
<p>two models at the perceptual level: signal enhancement (attention improves the quality of the stimulus representation) / external noise reduction (attention diminishes the impact of stimuli outside its focus)</p>
<p>DEBATE: does attention alter appearance?</p>
<p><strong>contrast is a basic dimension of vision and a natural candidate for understanding the relationship</strong></p>
<p>in this study:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the effects of transient attention on perceived contrast</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>method: enable us to directly assess apparent contrast while circumventing the methodological limitations of the previous ones</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>preclude response bias: an orientation discrimination task contingent to the stimulus that appeared higher in contrast (observers need to report the orientation with higher contrast stimulus, indeed interested in the contrast judgments)</p>
<ul>
<li>use two stimuli: Gabor patches (sinusoidal gratings of 2 or 4 cpd enveloped by a Gaussian, tilted 45 degree to the left or right)</li>
<li>one on each side of a fixation point</li>
<li>exp 1: keep the contrast of one Gabor fixed at a near-threshold level of 6% (standard patch) and varied the other one from trial to trial using a range contrast from 2.5 to 16%</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>psychometric function: the probability of choosing the test to the standard(?), as a function of their contrast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the test contrast at which this function reaches 50% is the point of subjective equality (PSE) (?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>measure the function:  both when transient covert attention was directed to a particular location via a peripheral cue and when it was directed to the center of the display via a neutral cue (uninformative in terms of both stimulus orientation and contrast)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>expectation:</p>
<ul>
<li>neutral condition: subjective equality to occur at physical equality</li>
<li>transient covert attention intensifies sensory impressions, and the test patch is cued: occur at lower test contrasts; and the standard patch is cued: occur at higher one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>details of method:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>observers:</p>
<ul>
<li>69 naive totally. (?)</li>
<li>exp 1( low contrast) , control 1, exp 2( high contrast) , control 2: 3 trained lab members + 13 observers(each)  <em>13*4=52</em></li>
<li>control 3: the same 3 + 7 naive + 10 observers <em>10+7=17</em></li>
<li>all observers were undergraduates for the New York University Subject Pool and naive as to the purpose of the study, normal/corrected-to-normal vision</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>apparatus:(?)</p>
<ul>
<li>G4 Power Macintosh(?)</li>
<li>view the stimuli on a gamma-corrected monitor</li>
<li>background luminance was set to 12.2 cd/m^2</li>
<li>use video attenuator to drive just the green gun of a 21 IBM P260 monitor, thus providing a larger possible set of distinct luminance levels(~12.6 bits)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>stimuli and design:</p>
<ul>
<li>in the center of a uniform gray background: a black square (0.1 degree multiply 0.1 degree) -&gt; fixation point, presented throughout the entire experiment</li>
<li>two types of cues: peripheral and neutral</li>
<li>peripheral: a small black dot(0.3 degree multiply 0.3 degree), appeared 1.5 degree above the center of the location where a stimulus was about to appear</li>
<li>neutral: the same black dot presented at fixation</li>
<li>target: two Gabor patches (sinusoidal gratings enveloped by a Gaussian, 2 degree multiply 2 degree), left/right at 4 degree eccentricity along the horizontal meridian.</li>
<li>the stimuli randomly varied with equal probability along a number of dimensions: spatial frequency, orientation, contrast</li>
<li>in a given trial, the spatial frequency of both was either 2 or 4 cpd. to avoid any adaptation effects.</li>
<li>stimuli: independently tilted 45 degree to right/left</li>
<li>exp 1: one was always at a fixed contrast of 6% as as standard, and the other as the test was randomly sampled from a set of Michelson contrasts in 9 log increments from 2.5% to 16%.</li>
<li>control 1: standard contrast was 8%</li>
<li>exp 2: the standard: 22%. the test: randomly sampled from a set of Michelson contrasts in 23 log increments from 6% to 79%. sample more intervals than in exp 1 to get a more precise psychometric function.</li>
<li>control 2: standard 22%</li>
<li>control 3: observers were asked to report the lower contrast stimulus, the contrast range was the same 6%-79%, but the test were sampled in 13 log increments. *Note that the lower contrasts 6%-16% overlap with the higher contrasts of exp 1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>procedure:</p>
<ul>
<li>block and trial: practice (one block, 75 trials) + exp (10 blocks, 200 trials each)   totally 1 h or so.</li>
<li>view the binocularly at a distance of 114 cm from the monitor.</li>
<li>fixate on the fixation point.</li>
<li>fixation point for 500 ms -&gt; peripheral/neutral cue for 67 ms -&gt; inter-stimulus interval for 53 ms -&gt; Gabor stimuli for 40 ms</li>
<li>they indicated the orientation of the Gabor that appeared higher in contrast: Z or X with the middle or index finger of left hand / '.' or '/' with the middle or index finger of right hand</li>
<li>informed that the peripheral cue was not informative either in terms of contrast or orientation and had equal probability</li>
<li>the 120 ms (67+53) between the cue and target onset: chosen to maximize the effect of the peripheral cue in automatically eliciting transient attention. / the 160 ms between cue onset and stimulus offset: chosen to preclude eye movements, thus ensuring that the observers performed the task under the conditions of covert attention.</li>
<li>control 1 and 2: the interval between the cue and target onset was increased to 500 ms. possible for eye movements and an infrared camera was used to monitor &amp; ensure they didn't break fixation</li>
<li>control 3: instructed in a different manner - report only which stimulus looked lower in contrast.</li>

<p>results</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>exp 1: low-contrast stimuli</strong></p>
<p>neutral cue: the PSE for both spatial frequency stimuli reflected the veridical percept. When both the same contrast 6% observers were at chance for reporting,.</p>
<p>peripheral cue: the PSE corresponded to lower test contrasts. Cuing the test stimulus reduced the test contrast required to match the standard. Cuing the standard one increased the test contrast required to match the standard. (means that cuing = higher contrast appearance)</p>
<p><em>A nested hypothesis test (Weibull with separate fits for each condition vs. one fit for both conditions collapsed together) revealed highly significant differences between the two conditions.</em> (?)</p>
<p>data from individual: scatter-plots, observer's PSEs from the neutral and peripheral cue conditions. Had there been no effect of attention on appearance, the data would have fallen on a line of slope. When the test was cued, PSEs were consistently lower.</p>
<p>Peripheral cue brought about a substantial change in perceived apparent contrast. a 3.5% contrast, 4 cpd cued test stimulus appeared to be 6%, and the cued stimulus at 6% appeared to be 8.5%. <em>This difference in apparent contrast has the potential to boost performance in discrimination and localization tasks from near-chance levels to near-perfect performance.</em> <strong>attention improved performance</strong>. At contrasts within the dynamic range of the appearance psychometric function, for both spatial frequencies, performance was better with the test cue than with the neutral cue. Attention improved performance by 10% at PSE and ranged from 18% at lower contrasts to 4% at higher contrasts.</p>
<p><strong>When observers' transient covert attention was drawn to a stimulus via a peripheral cue, observers reported that stimulus as being higher in contrast than it really was, thus indicating a change in appearance with attention.</strong></p>
<p>to control:</p>
<ul>
<li>control the bias: told prior that the peripheral cue had equal probability of appearing</li>
<li>to rule out the possibility that observer;s judgments were biased toward the stimulus location adjacent to the cue: a control exp 1 that extended the interval</li>
</ul>
<p>The time course for transient attention is short-lived: it peaks at ~120 ms and completely decays by ~ 250 ms.</p>
<p>(when the cue preceded the display by 500 ms, there were no systematic differences between the neutral and peripheral conditions.) (?)</p>
<p><strong>exp 2: high-contrast stimuli</strong></p>
<p>at the higher range of stimulus contrast, the attentional effect on appearance decreased, due to a ceiling effect: the upper bound does not leave room for improvement, thus restricting the possibility that observers' responses manifest an increased apparent contrast.</p>
<p>-&gt; in exp 2, investigated <strong>whether transient attention has the potential to alter the appearance of higher-contrast stimuli</strong></p>
<p>keep the contrast of the standard patch fixed at 22% and varied the contrast of the test patch from 6% to 79%</p>
<p>neutral cue: the PSE for both spatial frequency stimuli reflected the veridical percept; at chance for reporting when they were both at 22%.</p>
<p>test cue: reduce the test contrast required to match the standard</p>
<p>standard cue: increase the test contrast required</p>
<p>distribution of PSEs for individual were consistent with the avg.</p>
<p>a 16% contrast, 4 cpd cued test stimulus appeared to the observers to be 22%</p>
<p>the cued stimulus at 22% appeared as 28%</p>
<p><em>performance for 4 cpd was better for the test cue condition than for the neutral cue condition</em></p>
<p><em>attention improved performance by 10% at PSE and ranged from 15% at the lower contrasts to 4% at higher contrasts where performance reaches a maximum.</em></p>
<p><em>at 2 cpd, performance was at ceiling across contrast levels.</em></p>
<p>control 2: extended the interval. no systematic differences between the neutral and peripheral conditions. -&gt; <strong>when transient attention was no longer active, the appearance of the stimulus was not altered</strong></p>
<p><strong>exp 3: control exp 3 - lower contrast</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>to rule out the possibility of cue bias</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ask them to indicate only which of the two gratings looked lower in contrast without performing the orientation discrimination task</p>
<ul>
<li>if the effects were due to cue bias, when they would still have chosen the cued stimulus more often</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>also addressed the possibility that observers could have chosen the cued stimulus more often simply because the cue could have had a facilitatory effect on the orientation discrimination task</p>
<ul>
<li>then the cue would have no effect on appearance when they were not asked to report orientation</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>PSEs for cued and uncued stimuli differ; observers consistently reported the cued stimulus less often -&gt; they perceived cued stimuli to be higher in contrast</p>
<p><strong>even when the task instructions were changed to request report of lower contrast one, they still perceived the apparent contrast of a cued stimulus to be enhanced</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Diss:</p>
<p><em>it is a psychophysical procedure to directly address the phenomenological correlate of attention and appearance</em></p>
<p><strong>result: transient attention increases apparent contrast for a wide range of stimulus contrasts, enabling observers to perform better in a discrimination task</strong> &lt;=&gt; increased contrast sensitivity</p>
<p>Two attentional effects observed in neural responses:</p>
<ul>
<li>contrast gain: a shift in the contrast response function to the left (decreased threshold) &lt;=&gt; less contrast is necessary for an attending neuron to attain the same response level as a neutral (non-attending) neuron.</li>
<li>response gain: an increase in firing with increasing contrast (steeper slope) &lt;=&gt; an increase in strength of response for a neuron, particularly for higher contrasts</li>
</ul>
<p>present data: evidence for a contrast gain model (greater neuronal sensitivity or to say decreased threshold) &lt;=&gt; attention changes the strength of a stimulus by enhancing its effective contrast or salience.</p>
<p><em>The shallower slopes in the 4-cpd condition for the cued test stimulus are likely to result from the reduced range at the upper bounds of the psychometric function.</em></p>
<p><em>investigated the phenomenological correlate of attention as well as its effect on orientation discrimination</em></p>
<p><strong>the effects of covert attention on early visual processing</strong></p>
<p>visual attention is crucial in optimizing the systems' restricted capacity</p>
<hr>
<p>Conclude:</p>
<p><strong>covert attention does intensify the sensory impression of a stimulus</strong></p>
