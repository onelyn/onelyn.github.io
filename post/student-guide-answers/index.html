<h4 id="1-know-the-distinctions-between-empathy-and-emotional-contagion-mimicry-sympathy-compassion-perspective-taking-personal-distress">1) Know the distinctions between empathy and: emotional contagion, mimicry, sympathy, compassion, perspective taking, personal distress.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Empathy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Conceptualization: <strong>a shared <u>affective state</u> elicited by another, while still maintaining a <u>self-other distinction</u> and source of the emotion</strong></p>
<p>The distinction has important implications for whether the empathizer engages in prosocial or egoistic behavioral responding.</p>
<p>Basic monitoring of the origins of emotions as arising from oneself or the interacting &quot;other&quot; is essential to separate empathy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Emotional contagion</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&quot;feeling ourselves into&quot; another's emotion, &quot;catching&quot; it, emotional convergence.</p>
<p>the tendency to <u>automatically mimic and synchroniz</u>e facial expressions, vocalizations, postures, and movements with those of another person and consequently to converge emotionally. (doesn't necessitate self-other awareness)</p>
<p>Emotional contagion can be understood as one's tendency to &quot;catch&quot; another's emotional state.</p>
<p>Conceptualized as &quot;primitive empathy&quot;, and is the most primitive form of emotion sharing.</p>
<p>Includes elements of automatic information transference via mimicking expressions witch purportedly leads to an emotional convergence with the other.</p>
<p>Appears early in human development. Infants mimic to cry.</p>
<p>Vis a perception: action link. Or via the mirror neuron system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mimicry</p>
</blockquote>
<p>automatic, continuous synchronization of movements with the facial expressions, voice, postures, movements, and instrumental behaviors of others in a conversation with them, moment-to-moment.</p>
<p>no self-other and no affective state but require behavioral response</p>
<p>Mimicry is an unconscious imitation of another's behaviors without any insight to the purpose of their actions. Mimicry can take place in many forms, while the majority of research focus on facial expressions.</p>
<p>Mimicry develops early in life. Mimicry has been suggested to serve as a quick, low energy-requiring, apprehension of the interacting person's affective state.</p>
<p>Facial mimicry can occur when the mimicker does not necessarily experience the same subjective emotional experience, and varies across different social contexts. It's suggested by some that mimicry has only a small role in emotional contagion and is more important for promoting affiliation goals.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sympathy</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the heightened awareness of the suffering of another person as something to be alleviated. (negative emotions, doesn't require an isomorphic同形的 affective state, a motivation to act)</p>
<p>Sympathy can be defined as an &quot;affinity倾向性, association, or relationship between persons or things wherein whatever affects one similarly affects the other&quot;. Definitions vary in languages.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Compassion</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the feeling that arises in witnessing another's suffering and that motivates a subsequent desire to help. (negative emotions, doesn't require an isomorphic affective state, a motivation to act)</p>
<p>Compassion: pleasant/both pleasant and unpleasant (argue)</p>
<p>A new conceptualization added to compassion: understanding the universality of suffering; tolerance of uncomfortable emotions.</p>
<p>Compassion is a process that includes <em>noticing, feeling, and responding</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>noticing: recognition and awareness (conscious, cognitive awareness, unconscious affective responses)</li>
<li>feeling: an experience of sympathy towards the individual under awareness</li>
<li>responding: a desire to help</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Perspective taking</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the ability to consciously put oneself into the mind of another individual and imagine what that person is thinking or feeling. (no affective state, require cognitive component)</p>
<p>Cognitive processes can initiate empathy. This can happen via active perspective taking, or via empathy. Mere elicitation of an emotion will regularly be accompanied by associated thoughts.</p>
<p>Cognition can be used to sustain empathy. This can manifest as cognitive strategies to regulate uncomfortable emotion states by processes such as intentional emotion suppression, cognitive reappraisal or attentional distraction.  Cognition <em>can</em> serve for empathy but is <em>not required</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>//Empathic concern//</p>
</blockquote>
<p>other-oriented emotion elicited by and congruent with the perceived welfare of someone in need. (negative emotions, doesn't require an isomorphic affective state, a motivation to act)</p>
<p>Differences between empathic concern vs. empathy: Empathy can be felt with both positive and negative emotions || Empathic concern only with negative emotions and perhaps particularly with sadness. Empathy is neither ultimately other- nor self-focused. Empathy is not necessarily connected to prosocial behavior. || Empathic concern is other-focused and can be either an antecedent or consequence of personal distress. (but sometimes they experience empathic concern but can't help)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Personal distress</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a self-oriented, aversive emotional reaction such as anxiety or discomfort. (self-oriented, affective state)</p>
<p>Empathic distress, like personal distress, can lead to prosocial behavior under specific circumstances. However, it is more associated with self-focused behavior that will efficiently alleviate the observer's own suffering. Empathic concern/sympathy and sympathetic distress instead focus on helping the other that extends beyond any benefit that is accrued by the self.</p>
<p><strong>Empathy is foremost an affective process, albeit one than can be moderated by cognitive factors. Empathy requires a distinction between the boundaries of self and other. Empathy can be experienced towards any emotion, regardless of valence.</strong></p>

<p>情，志，理，同，共</p>
<p>共情，同理心，神入，移情，共鸣，同感，投情..</p>
<p>body: 身体 = person or self with all the connotations of the physical, social and mindful (身=body person, 体=physical body+style, form, convention and agency , 形，躯，尸)</p>
<p>body = container, separate from the experiencing subject.</p>
<p>精神：constitutes the body (kidney性格, heart) (精=concentrated root of life, vitality, stored in the kidneys, 神=manifestation of that life, life activity itself, governed by the heart)</p>
<p>Heart and brain both part of 身体</p>
<p>心 heart-mind: more than an organ; has social and moral implications; interconnected with brain in Chinese medicine; not only in emotion terms</p>
<p>脑 brain: originally thought of as part of the 心 system; used interchangeably with 心 in daily life and in academic discourse emphasizing the mental capability without 心</p>
<p>emotional diseases: 神志病 (mind-related disorders)</p>
<p>七情 seven emotive or mental activities; 气 vital energy; 五脏 five viscera</p>
<p>情志 refers specifically to seven emotions.</p>
<p>五志：喜，怒，悲，惊，思</p>
<p>Both 情 and 志 can be translated as emotions.</p>
<p>Distinctions among the visceral systems influence changes in emotions, and emotional changes induce physiological changes. These emotional activities when kept in certain 度 are said to be normal phenomena.</p>
<p>五脏 六腑 join each other to form a complex of functions that links all parts of the body in processes of producing normal and pathological effects.</p>
<p>五行：金木水火土   五行 reasoning has a particular role in treating emotional disorders. Since the emotions are said to be correspondent to specific functions of different visceral organ systems, they are also accountable in terms of the 五行 relationships.</p>
<p>情志 and transformative 气: the material basis of life; promotes the activities of life and functions to warm up the body</p>
<p>Functions: promoting human physiological activities, keeping up the body's temperature, defending the body from the invasion of 邪气, reinforcing and conserving the vital substance of the body, transforming bodily substances.</p>
<p>情志 functions are also understood in terms of 气 transformations.</p>

<p>Cognitive empathy: ability of perspective taking, often synonymous with theory of mind.</p>
<p>Theory of Mind: &quot;theory&quot; - umbrella term for children's understanding of mental states (to predict behavior of others; to explain behavior of others; to manipulate behavior of others); most fundamental mental states - belief &amp; desire;</p>
<p>false belief task: the changing point from below chance level to pass the task to above chance level to pass the task is about 4 years of age.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>variables not affecting the age of success: period the study came from (later studies/earlier onset); type of test question; character being real or not;  -&gt; not depending on surface features</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>variables affecting: temporal marking (interaction affect with age; how the child is asked by using or not using temporal markers; eg. look <em>first</em>, <em>before he feel asleep</em>; interaction increases success in older children); the motive (if task is given without explanation=child feels &quot;tricked&quot;, performance increases across all age groups); the salience of the false belief(if the salience is high, increases success); participation (better if <em>being</em> not <em>watching</em>); target object becomes absent; country (age structure);</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>None of them improved performance of 3-year-olds beyond chance. -&gt; no early competence</p>
<p>&quot;think from an other's perspective&quot; need a certain degree of maturation, of experiencing the world and forming conceptualizations of the world.</p>
<p>Theories to explain:</p>
<ul>
<li>theory theory: acquire a representational understanding of &quot;mind&quot; instead of behavior only</li>
<li>simulation theory: simulate what they would do under the same circumstances and use that as a theory to understand others' actions</li>
<li>modular theories of mind: every human being has specialized parts in the brain that are dedicated to the theory of mind</li>
</ul>
<p>We seem to be better at predicting our own emotions to an event when we know how other people reacted rather than knowing more details of the event itself, but believe the opposite.</p>
<p>We seem to be better at guessing another person's emotions correctly when we see the same target that they see rather than interpreting their bodily reactions, but believe the opposite.</p>
<h4 id="5-know-and-understand-the-general-idea-of-the-neck-problem-and-the-lens-problem-and-the-role-of-context-cf-epley-2014">5) Know and understand the general idea of “the neck problem” and “the lens problem” and the role of context (cf. Epley, 2014).</h4>
<p>When two different necks are pointing their heads in different directions, they are attending to different information and basing their evaluations on fundamentally different viewpoints. -&gt; neck problem</p>
<p>You can look at the same thing using different lenses of interpretation. -&gt; lens problem</p>
<p>Get over yourself; stereotype; common sense mislead action</p>
<p>Three ways why our stereotypes go wrong: getting too little information, defining groups by their differences, being unable to observe the true causes of group differences directly.</p>
<h4 id="6-know-the-phenomenon-called-emotional-contagion-and-its-main-mechanisms-mimicry-feedback">6) Know the phenomenon called “emotional contagion” and its main mechanisms (mimicry, feedback).</h4>
<p>Emotional contagion can be understood as one's tendency to &quot;catch&quot; another's emotional state.</p>
<p>Conceptualized as &quot;primitive empathy&quot;, and is the most primitive form of emotion sharing.</p>
<p>Includes elements of automatic information transference via mimicking expressions witch purportedly leads to an emotional convergence with the other.</p>
<p>Appears early in human development. Infants mimic to cry.</p>
<p>Vis a perception: action link. Or via the mirror neuron system.</p>
<p>The most responsible mechanism: automatic mimicry. Mimicry is an unconscious imitation of another's behaviors without any insight to the purpose of their actions. Mimicry can take place in many forms, while the majority of research focus on facial expressions.</p>
<p>Mimicry develops early in life. Mimicry has been suggested to serve as a quick, low energy-requiring, apprehension of the interacting person's affective state.</p>
<p>Facial mimicry can occur when the mimicker does not necessarily experience the same subjective emotional experience, and varies across different social contexts. It's suggested by some that mimicry has only a small role in emotional contagion and is more important for promoting affiliation goals.</p>
<p>Facial feedback:  Inform the expresser that they are experiencing a particular emotion. Adopting a facial configuration of a given emotion is theorized to produce afferent传入的 feedback that is distinct to the adopted configuration, thus eliciting or strengthening the subjective experience of the given emotion.</p>
<p>The interpersonal mimicry of facial expressions should influence the affective state of the receiving person to match the sender. Facial EMG studies have often shown that mimicry in response to facial expressions, even if presented at a sub-conscious duration, will induce contagion of the corresponding emotion.</p>
<h4 id="7-know-and-understand-zakis-motivated-model-of-empathy">7) Know and understand Zaki’s motivated model of empathy.</h4>
<p><strong>Although empathy *can be* automatic, by no means is it *always* automatic.</strong></p>
<p>It is also deeply context dependent and varies along with numerous situational features.</p>
<p>empathy -&gt; motivated phenomenon</p>
<p>approach motives &amp;&amp; avoidance motives (toward actions) ; affective motives (toward emotions)</p>
<p>People will sometimes approach even negative emotions that are consistent with their goals. (anger prior to a conflict, sadness prior to seeking help)</p>
<p>avoid: pain, costs, interference with competition</p>
<p>approach: positive affect, affiliation, desirability</p>
<p>strategies: situation selection, attention modulation, appraisal</p>

<p>The firing of mirror neurons during the observation of actions performed by another individual may code the equivalence between oneself and others. Once this mapping is achieved, an understanding of one's own emotions and intentions can be used to inform the understanding of others' behavior.</p>
<p>in the macaque brain, where neurons in ventral pre-motor cortex (area F5) and the inferior parietal lobule (PF) fire either when the monkey executes goal-related hand actions or when observing.</p>
<p>understanding not only others' actions but their intentions and mental states -&gt; emotions -&gt; the anterior portions of the insula play an important role in achieving an emotion representation by connecting the limbic system to mirror areas</p>
<ul>
<li>only around 20% of the corresponding MNs firing during observation. (pale reflection)</li>
<li>correlated to dispositional empathy</li>

<h4 id="9-know-and-understand-the-major-ideas-of-the-theory-of-constructed-emotion-barrett-2017">9) Know and understand the major ideas of the Theory of Constructed Emotion (Barrett, 2017).</h4>
<p>Natural selection prefers high complexity systems because they can reconfigure themselves into a multitude of different states.</p>
<p>The brain achieves complexity through &quot;degeneracy&quot; = the capacity for dissimilar representations to give rise to instances of the same category in the same context = ubitiquous无处不在的</p>
<p>The summary representation of any emotion category is an abstraction that need not exist in nature.</p>
<p>Core task of the brain: allostasis稳态 =efficiently ensuring the resources for physiological systems within an animal's body so that an animal can grow, survive and reproduce. = predictively regulating the inner milieu.  Allostasis is an ongoing <strong>process</strong> of how the brain regulates the body according to costs and benefits.</p>
<p>Efficiency requires the ability to anticipate the body's needs and satisfy them before they arise.</p>
<p>=&gt; the brain makes predictions about the needs that are based on its internal model which is constantly being created and updated by statistical/experiential information from the external and internal world.</p>
<p>Perception, cognition, and emotion are localized in dedicated brain systems, with perception triggering emotions that battle with cognition to control behavior.</p>
<p>Your brain uses past experience, organized as concepts, to guide your actions and give your sensations meaning. When the concepts involved are emotion concepts, your brain constructs instances of emotion. -&gt; based on social reality and our constant <strong>predictions</strong>.</p>

<li>Multidimensional Emotional Empathy Scale (MDEES):  Focus on the affective component of empathy.</li>
<li><strong>Empathy Quotient (EQ)</strong>:  <strong>empathy - the drive to identify another person's emotions and thoughts, and to respond to these with an appropriate emotion.</strong> Some says it aims both cognitive and affective components. Others argue the scale may consist of three factors. The EQ items tend to focus more on measuring the empathetic process rather than the empathy construct itself.</li>
<li>Feeling and Thinking Scale (FTS):  An adaptation of the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI) for use with children. The IRI contains four independent sub-scales: empathic concern, perspective taking, personal distress, fantasy.</li>
<li>Basic Empathy Scale (BES):  Empathy - sharing and understanding of another's emotional state or context resulting from experiencing the emotive state (affective) and understanding another's (cognitive) emotions.</li>
<li>Griffith Empathy Measure (GEM):  Assess parents' level of agreement with statements concerning their child.  Measure cognitive and affective components of empathy.  Seems stable but not shows high internal consistency.</li>
<li>Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ):  Did not begin with a conceptual definition of empathy other than to consider it at the broadest level and derive a measure based on existing empathy scales.</li>

<p>Ma-Kellams &amp; Lerner Method:</p>
<p>Mock interview (random assignment interviewer/interviewee) 3 minutes long; scripted questions; test instruments are positive and negative affect scale &amp; cognitive reflection test; empathic accuracy - intraclass correlation coefficients of PANAS (self-assessment vs. partner's rations about oneself)</p>
<p>Existing measures may give rough impressions of what is going on during empathic encounters, but for a better precision we need to tap into the complex, mutual process of meaning making. In how far that becomes measurable remains a question.</p>
<h4 id="13-understand-the-general-idea-of-intersubjectivity-via-phenomenology-the-self-incl-the-idea-of-a-primitive-self-and-how-that-relates-to-empathy">13) Understand the general idea of intersubjectivity (via phenomenology), the self (incl. the idea of a “primitive self”) and how that relates to empathy.</h4>
<p>intersubjectivity = experiencing the other as a subject (person) rather than another object in the world (the world is experienced as a shared world instead of a world only accessible to myself, which makes the experience intersubjective. The experience goes beyond my personal intentionality.)</p>
<p>There's no pure, experience-independent, experiential self that could be found or even located somewhere in the brain. &quot;Self&quot; is not only a &quot;collection of stories&quot; that we recall and change during an encounter, every other necessarily resists or exceeds our narratives.</p>
<p>There might be a more &quot;primitive self&quot;, i.e. the idea that <em>it is I</em> who has a certain experience, but when it comes to higher-order concepts (interpretations), we need a shared, normative ground that can only be established with others in the lifeworld. There's no self without others.</p>
<p>The first step in empathy is the insight, that <em>another human being has a mind of his/her own like me</em> which might be different from my mind and will remain mysterious to me because <em>I can never directly access it</em>.</p>
<p>I and the other react to each other moment-to-moment and we co-create all of our experience together as part of our shared worlds and with our particular becomeness so far. The other creates who I am and I create who the other is in a certain moment of time, in a particular situation, this process can be called &quot;<strong>the self</strong>&quot; (&quot;selfing&quot;).</p>
<p>When I empathize, I make my whole bing available to the other, I intentionally &quot;am&quot; at that certain moment on the other's behalf. The other might not necessarily reciprocate with a similarly empathic stance, but will still influence me continuously .</p>
<p>&quot;it is my feeling, but it was brought about jointly by me and the other in this moment&quot;. &quot;it's not about me, it's about the other.&quot;</p>
<h4 id="14-know-theodor-lippss-as-well-as-the-major-representatives-of-phenomenology-husserl-stein-scherer-schuetz-and-their-main-ideas-about-empathy">14) Know Theodor Lipps’s as well as the major representatives of phenomenology (Husserl, Stein, Scherer, Schuetz) and their main ideas about empathy.</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Lipps</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Lipps</u> 's theory of empathy accepts the basic but questionable assumption that all we can be said to perceive is physical qualities and their changes, such as the distortion of facial muscles, and that this perceptual input is psychologically meaningless. It is only by animating what is perceptually given with what we know from our own case that we can come to know that we are encountering another minded creature. It is only by drawing on our own inner experience that we are able to move from the input to the actual ascription to others of mental states, such as joy or happiness.</p>
<p>Lipps argue that empathy involves two steps: imitation and projection. My perception of the other's expression will evoke a feeling in myself, and the feeling is then attributed to the other through projection.</p>
<p>Lipps认为共情是因为共情对象富有表现力，从而迫使 (impute)共情者感受到注视共情对象时所发生的体验；外在物体或人将活动强加给了共情者。使共情者被动地、直觉地模仿，在模仿中获得感受；当共情者获得外在客体的内在活动时，会与外在客体相联合，产生与之一体感(oneness)，Lipps 称其为最圆满的共情，也称为同感共鸣的(sympathetic)共情， 是同感的一种形式；Lipps认为如果故意模仿他人动作。则是在制作他人内在活动的心理意象，共情不包含任何心理意象。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scheler</p>
</blockquote>
<p><u>Scheler</u>:  In order to feel concern/sympathy, you first need to realize or recognize that the other is indeed suffering. Prior cognitive understanding.</p>
<p>It is possible to empathize with somebody while being indifferent to his plight.   One can be infected by the feelings of others, not only without knowing anything about the other individuals but also without knowing anything about their intentional objects.</p>
<p>Scheler: a perceptual theory of other minds - empathy</p>
<p>Reject the proposal that empathy should be based on a direct association between cues and one's own similar past experiences.</p>
<p>Scheler: we are confronted neither with a mere body nor with a pure soul but with the unity of an embodied mind. (expressive unity)</p>
<p>移情的发生不需要建立在知晓另一个行为者的行为或表情等基础上，凡是精神活动的符号我们就可以把握，而且除非我们预先已经知道那个行为、表情蕴含的情感，否则不可直接引向精神状况。本质上是一种内感知，这种经验与他者自身体验同一。</p>
<ul>
<li>Scheler: we can experience not only our own experiences but also those of another, through a kind of inner experience or intuition.</li>
<li>Scheler defines inner intuition as an act that grasps the psychical, regardless of whether it is my own or that of the other.</li>
<li>Scheler: there are dimensions of the other that are absolutely inaccessible to others.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Husserl and Stein</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Stein, empathy is quite generally the term of choice for the experience of another consciousness.</p>
<p>Others' experiences can never be given to me in the same original fashion as my own experiences, they are not accessible to me through inner consciousness. Rather, they are appresented through a special form of apperception, or to use a different terminology, they are co-intended and characterized by a certain co-presence.</p>
<p>Stein rejects that empathy should make us undergo the emotion we perceive in the other.</p>
<p>Husserl distinguish two different attitudes that we can take towards the other: naturalistic/personalistic.</p>
<p>When I perceive an object, the object is never given in its totality but always incompletely.  Our perceptual consciousness is characterized that we persistently transcend the intuitively given profile in order to grasp the object itself (full object-consciousness).  There are differences between empathy and object perception. We can grasp the other and what he/she is living through much more vividly; but the objected can be in turn present if required while the other's experiences can't.</p>
<p>My experiential acquaintance with the mind of the other differs from my first-person acquaintance with my own mind. The minds we experience are <em>other</em> minds. Although I do not have access to the first-personal character of the other's experience, the fact that there is more to the other's experience than what I am grasping is salient to me.</p>
<p>Our empathic understanding of another subjectivity involves an element of apperception or interpretation. Central notion: coupling (pairing) . Coupling: patterns of understanding are gradually established through a process of sedimentation沉积作用 and they thereby come to influence subsequent experiences. My previous experiences influence my current understanding.</p>
<p>A process of analogizing doesn't lead to the apprehension of anything truly new.</p>
<p>Assumptions: empathy is a unitary concept; its object is the other subject.</p>
<p>Stein: other-experience - try to understand and don't view it as an object - an understood other-experience</p>
<p>Husserl's model: sensing and perceiving empathy; appresentation of the other; purposefulness of the action and grasps; appropriating foreign tradition.</p>
<p>Husserl denies that I normally thematize the other as an object when empathizing. Emphasize that the other, rather than being given to me simply as a nucleus of experiences, is given as a center of orientation. The other is given as intentional, as directed at the same world as I, and the other's world. The meaning the world has for the other affects the meaning it has for me. My own perspective on the world will be enriched through my empathic understanding of the other.</p>
<p>施泰因不仅将共情作为“主体间性经验的基础”，而且进而将其作为“获得存在的外部世界的可能知识的条件”。这就是说，通过共情，人们既理解了他人的心灵，又通过他人的经验意识反诸自身，理解了自己（强调了他人是以一个“我”而不只是世界的一个对象存在于我的意识中）。 移情最重要的是非原初性，是他人的，仅仅是对这种体验的理解和对这种距离的确认。也不等于外感知，情感不能被基于，而是我意识到。</p>
<p>胡塞尔：移情所获得的他人的体验虽然是以切身的方式直观地给予我，但和他人的体验不同，不能以原始方式基于我，对我来说不能通过内在意识而表达。不能实现完全的重合，没有内感知，只有外感知。</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Schutz</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While he recognizes the fundamental and irreducible character of the face-to-face encounter, at the same time he emphasizes the heterogeneity异质性 of interpersonal understanding. (variety and complexity)</p>
<p>The body of the other is no mere physical object but a field of expression that reveals the experiential life of the other. External behavior of the other indicates his subjective experiences, or it may refer to the fact that the subject 'is deliberately seeking to express something' by acting in a certain way.</p>
<p>Thou-orientation: general thesis of the other self; other-orientation; the other is bodily co-present and immediately given as a psychophysical unity. Directed at the living reality of the other; with an awareness of the presence of the other, but not with any specific awareness of what is going on in the other's mind. -&gt; real life: with their own personal characteristics and traits.</p>
<p>They-orientation: no direct expressive movements or acts, my understanding is always general in form, shaped and framed by structures of typicality. Conceive as a type and leave individual characteristic. Close friends: assume they remain homogeneous and stay the same. (habitual ideal types) -&gt; Typificaiton (and stereotyping) consequently facilitates everyday predictability.  The ideal types we acquire become part of our stock of knowledge and start to influence our face-to-face interactions as well. (as interpretative schemes)</p>
<p>The phenomenologist deny the  claim that empathy involves a simulation-plus-projection routine. Deny that empathy is a projective process that centrally involves either the imaginative adaptation of another's point of view or at least some form of inner imitation.</p>
<h4 id="15-be-familiar-with-fuchss-distinction-of-primary-extended-and-reiterated-empathy">15) Be familiar with Fuchs’s distinction of primary, extended, and reiterated empathy.</h4>
<p>Primary empathy: direct corporeal contact with another person, i.e. the interactive process in which both partners are immersed (enactivism, mutual incorporation, extended body)</p>
<p>Extended empathy: empathic understanding, adding information and inferences (eg. what could have made him so angry? why was he particularly sensitive in this particular situation?)</p>
<p>Reiterated empathy: I experiencing you as an other who experiences me as an other to you. I am experiencing my body in the first person &quot;I&quot;, but it also appear to you in the second person mode &quot;you&quot;, and in empathically grasping that experience of you, I experience myself as other to you.</p>
<h4 id="16-know-blooms-main-criticisms-against-empathy-as-a-panacea-to-the-problems-of-the-world-in-general">16) Know Blooms main criticisms against empathy as a panacea to the problems of the world in general.</h4>
<p>Empathy = process of experiencing the world as others do, or at least as you think they do (cognitive, affective)</p>
<p>Empathy is biased, more likely towards people who are like you.</p>
<p>Empathy is narrow, focus on individuals, insensitive to statistics, irrational decision if public policy is based on it.</p>
<p>Extreme empathy leads to asymmetrical不对称的 relationships, empathic distress &amp; exhaustion.</p>
<p>Doctors should be calm when I am anxious, confident when I am uncertain, not feeling what I feel.</p>
<p>Empathic friends can be invasive侵入的 with their (forced-upon-me) empathy.</p>
<p>Better: compassion</p>

<p>When you (describe action without evaluation), I feel (share feeling) because I (state need/value). Would you consider (state concrete request)?</p>
<p>description: observe (see, hear, remember, imagine, free from evaluation)</p>
<p>feeling: feel (emotion or sensation rather than thought) in relation to what is observed</p>
<p>need: need/value (rather than a preference or a specific action) that causes the feeling</p>
<p>request: the concrete actions that would like taken</p>
