<p>Seeing 情志 and disordered 情志 as an interactive social phenomenon and embodied experience informed with the cultural sensibilities of 通, 度, 和(harmony).</p>
<h3 id="情-emotion">情 emotion</h3>
<p>Some: Emotion-tacit Chinese who through socialization have learned that personal affects, especially negative or disphoric emotions, should not be openly expressed.</p>
<p>Others: Chinese emotions are natural phenomena lacking important social and symbolic significance &quot;for the maintenance and perpetuation of social relationships&quot;</p>
<p>Also: banned cross-class crying at funerals &lt;=&gt; emotion is indeed a social performance and establish social relationship</p>
<p>The cultural sensibility of shame and face-saving does play its role in the way Chinese express and experience their emotions.</p>
<p>Express anger or other strong emotions frequently.</p>
<p>Expressing emotion is always open to social and moral interpretations and judgment. Emotions such as 义愤 and 公愤 are used frequently to justify social actions.</p>
<p>The expression of emotions in Chinese society is highly contextualized and that in certain social contexts expressiveness and aggression are tolerated, sanctioned, and even expected.</p>
<p>A more informative way is to map out a network of meanings, situations, experience and events.</p>
<p>情 hardly translates unambiguously.</p>
<p>荀子 sees 情 as a person's natural tendency of likes and dislikes, joy, anger and sadness.</p>
<p>The definition today stresses the interaction of human beings with their environment.  Seem to be broader than emotive states and includes reality configurations like 爱情，情欲，人情，情理</p>
<p>情 is a relational and situational concept.</p>
<p>Emotions are not talked about and experienced as abstract concepts but in relation to particular social situations.</p>
<h4 id="情-as-sensibility-of-face">情 as sensibility of face</h4>
<p>Face is frequently expressed and experienced in terms of emotions.</p>
<p>面子 is about social status and prestige.</p>
<p>Those who have a strong sense of self-respect are more sensitive to 面子</p>
<p>脸 depends on the sense of shame, a painful feeling similar to guilt.</p>
<p>面子和脸 are not two totally separate phenomena. Both involve social norms and a personal sense of pride and shame.</p>
<p>Face is more flexible in Chinese in usage than feelings.</p>
<p>Can be experienced and talked about in terms of emotions.</p>
<p>Face can extend to include groups with which one is identified.  Chinese society is connected in such an extensive way that everybody can potentially lose everybody else's face. (students-teachers-parents-...)</p>
<p>In the culture that makes 脸面 central to the concept of person, emotional expression itself is the performance of a person, which is subject to social evaluation and interpretation. Important: what context and how to express</p>
<p>subject, don't mean never or every time.</p>
<h4 id="情-as-social-relations">情 as social relations</h4>
<p>The concept of 感情 varies in Chinese. Its translation depends on the context.  人情 is seen fundamentally as social relations.</p>
<p>have feelings - 有感情   rather: a process of doing a relationship in concrete social situations</p>
<p>Relationship is confirmed through the language of work and suffering.</p>
<p>人情 based on concrete social relations, is not conceptualized as something that can be isolated as inner feelings.</p>
<p>There is no meaningful inside that is without an outside correspondence in speech, action, or inaction.</p>
<h4 id="情-as-social-norms-and-moral-comments">情 as social norms and moral comments</h4>
<p>情理  情义</p>
<p>Different social relations may evoke a different set of 理 and 义 that demand styles of behavior and of emotion appropriate to the relational context. eg. 亲情, is characterized as 慈 and 孝.</p>
<p>The Chinese tend to associate anger with illness and even death. 气死人</p>
<p>By complaining that their illnesses are anger related, patients hold somebody else morally accountable for their sufferings.</p>
<h4 id="情-as-embodied-experience">情 as embodied experience</h4>
<p>情志 on the one hand, is unmistakably recognized as social in nature and always understood as the concrete emotions of 喜，怒，忧，思，悲，恐，惊. These are contextualized responses of an individual in experiencing the concrete particularity of lived situations.</p>
<p>Interpersonal relationship and inability to deal with it are the main factors contributing to 情志 disorders.</p>
<p>Changes in thought/feelings will have consequences in physiological changes, and therefore, experiential changes.</p>
<p>身体 body-person, both body and the person.</p>
<p>Don't stay angry or you will harm your 身体.</p>
<h3 id="physiology-of-情志">Physiology of  情志</h3>
<p>情志 refers specifically to seven emotions.</p>
<p>五志：喜，怒，悲，惊，思</p>
<p>Both 情 and 志 can be translated as emotions.</p>
<p>But some argue that 情 are manifested显 emotions and 志 are latent隐</p>
<p>志 is understood as the latent or neutralized 中和 state in the process of emotions. They are two terms referring to different stages of the same process.</p>
<h3 id="情志-and-the-visceral内脏-systems">情志 and the visceral内脏 systems</h3>
<p>Distinctions among the visceral systems influence changes in emotions, and emotional changes induce physiological changes.  These emotional activities when kept in certain 度 are said to be normal phenomena.</p>
<p>五脏 六腑 join each other to form a complex of functions that links all parts of the body in processes of producing normal and pathological effects.</p>
<p>脏象学  脏 refers to the dynamic and relational processes of visceral systems of a living body and 象 to be observable manifestations.</p>
<p>corresponds and interacts, has manifested configurations</p>
<p>脏象学 not only specifies that the physiological functions of 五脏六腑 are interconnected and their equilibrium and harmony are essential for a healthy process of 身体 but also indicates that the physiological network extends to include the mental and social environments through the demonstrated continuity from inside to outside and from 脏腑 systems to mental and emotional aspects of a person.</p>
<p>脏象 system in fact implies a larger physiology of body-person that goes beyond the boundary of physical body.</p>
<h3 id="the-five-transformative-phases">The five transformative phases</h3>
<p>五行：金木水火土</p>
<p>What links the five materials in nature to the five transformative phases is not what the five materials essentially are but what are observed to be characteristics of the former.</p>
<p>Important: how each phase in its own way, acts on other phases according to certain sequences.</p>
<p>production生 restraint克 violation诲 encroachment乘</p>
<p>Constantly aware that any of these activities may surpass its degree and become excessive or may fall short and become insufficient, thus having 诲 and 乘.</p>
<p>五行 reasoning has a particular role in treating emotional disorders. Since the emotions are said to be correspondent to specific functions of different visceral organ systems, they are also accountable in terms of the 五行 relationships.</p>
<p>以情胜情 eg. bring out the sadness to lessen the anger.</p>
<h3 id="情志-and-transformative-气">情志 and transformative 气</h3>
<p>the material basis of life</p>
<p>promotes the activities of life and functions to warm up the body</p>
<p>Functions: promoting human physiological activities, keeping up the body's temperature, defending the body from the invasion of 邪气, reinforcing and conserving the vital substance of the body, transforming bodily substances.</p>
<p>情志 functions are also understood in terms of 气 transformations.</p>
<p>The emotional impact on bodily processes is not significant in terms of chemical changes but in terms of altered 气 movement.</p>
<p>angry - move up; happy - relaxed; sad - dissipated...</p>
<p>Excessive emotional activities are said to upset the upset the normal motion of 气 relevant to its specific visceral functions.</p>
