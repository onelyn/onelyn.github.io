                <p>Briefly discuss the multiple definitions of empathy across sub-fields, illustrate how these different characterizations of empathy have influenced research in the neurosciences. Focus on a developmental definition of empathy and examine how this construct may be supported by a particular neural mechanism, the mirror neuron system (MNS).</p>
<h2 id="definitions-of-empathy">Definitions of Empathy</h2>
<p>many forms</p>
<p>Lipps (early definition): &quot;feeling into&quot; another individual;s emotional state</p>
<p>many suggest that empathy is a cognitive process of taking someone else's perspective, or imagining how that  individual would feel in a particular situation.</p>
<p>others point out that empathy, while being characterized as an emotional state that is isomorphic with that of another individual, also requires one to e consciously aware that the other individual is the source of the emotion in order to preclude self-focused distress and to foster other-oriented concern.</p>
<p>all contain some relatively explicit or intentional components --- entail the volitional意志的 act of &quot;putting oneself into somebody else's shoes&quot;. Also rely on a foundation of shared affect between self and other.</p>
<p>the developmental psychology: empathy is &quot;an affective reaction that results from the apprehension or comprehension of another's emotional state or condition, and that is identical or very similar to what the other person is feeling or would be expected to feel&quot;, or &quot;an affective response that is more appropriate to another's situation than one's own&quot;</p>
<p>the shared affect between self and other: experiential core of empathy, often associated with the construct of emotional contagion (one's emotional state results from the perception of another individual's emotion and from nonconscious behavioral mimicry of other's facial, vocal and bodily expressions (chameleon effect) ).Emotional contagion and nonconscious mimicry help to coordinate behavior and emotions between interaction partners and may serve communicative functions.</p>
<p>Mimicry is also evident very early in development. Infants cry in response to other infant's distress. Empathic-like responses or competing for attention? Imitative abilities of infants are supported by an innate system whereby seen actions(performed by others) are matched with felt actions(performed by oneself).</p>
<p>The general relationship between empathy and interpersonal competence: empathy can be defined to some extent by the pro-social responses that it provokes (eg. help or expressions of concern), or by the social dysfunction associated with its absence. From this perspective, empathic behaviors are first seen during the second year of life and are associated with increasing self-other differentiation and self-recognition(infants no)</p>
<p>The emphasis on emotion and affect sharing rather than cognition in developmental approaches to empathy probably reflects the contribution of two factors: this emphasis helps to distinguish empathy from more general theory-of-mind abilities (as a cognitive process of reasoning about other's mental states); the latter developmental process is known to extend at least through the first decade of life, thus one could hypothesize that the neural mechanisms supporting empathy might change with development (being able to feel what others feel might be a phylogenetic and ontogenetic precursor to more explicit processes of reasoning through what others feel) Affective aspects of empathy such as emotional contagion and affect sharing (infants) are earlier than the explicit cognitive perspective-taking components of empathy.</p>
<h2 id="neural-correlates-of-empathy">Neural correlates of empathy</h2>
<p>Affective components may include some kind of shared feeling or emotional resonance, which may or may not be conscious.</p>
<p>Studies examine the cognitive components of empathy compare imagining or observing emotional or painful situations. happening to oneself versus another individual. One region consistently active across these types of studies is the inferior parietal lobule (IPL), an area associated with multi-sensory integration. The laterality of activity(strong in the left hemisphere for self-perspectives and the right for other) might support the process of making self-other distinctions or attributing agency. The temporo-parietal junction (TPJ), particular in the right, has been associated with determining the contents of others' mental states. Two other brain regions: the temporal poles and medial prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>similar but still earlier response then the experiences are at the self; and more intensely to self-perspectives</p>
<p>Examining the neural correlates of perspective taking and self-other distinctions highlights ways in which the brain supports empathy through relatively explicit,cognitive means that are distinct from the processes supporting other kinds of social and nonsocial cognition. This approach parallels behavioral approaches in suggesting that mentalizing is accomplished by naive psychology theories, which may be derived from innate domain-specific modules or developed during childhood but which are unique to thinking about other people. An alternative approach conceives of mentalizing not in terms of special sets of rules and processes used to think about other individuals, but rather in terms of how the knowledge of one's own thoughts and feelings may be used to understand others via simulation, using the self as a model either implicitly.</p>
<p>shared networks in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and anterior insula seem to be involved in both feeling pain and observing someone else experience pain.</p>
<h2 id="the-mirror-neuron-system-and-emotion-understanding">The mirror neuron system and emotion understanding</h2>
<p>in the macaque brain, where neurons in ventral pre-motor cortex (area F5) and the inferior parietal lobule (PF) fire either when the monkey executes goal-related hand actions or when observing.</p>
<p>understanding not only others' actions but their intentions and mental states -&gt; emotions -&gt; the anterior portions of the insula play an important role in achieving an emotion representation by connecting the limbic system to mirror areas</p>
<p>a particular emotional expression is just another type of action associated with a motor plan that is activated via the firing of mirror neurons</p>
<p>once this mapping is achieved, an understanding of one's own emotions and intentions can be used to inform the understanding of others' behavior.</p>
<h2 id="the-mirror-neuron-system-and-empathy">The mirror neuron system and empathy</h2>
<p>MNS is associated with the affective processes that support empathy.</p>
<p>The significant correlation between empathy and MNS activity -&gt; mirroring the affective responses of others</p>
<p>IRI (interpersonal reactivity index), four sub-scales:</p>
<ul>
<li>empathic concern: the tendency to experience sympathy and related positive emotions oriented toward others</li>
<li>personal distress: the tendency to experience anxiety and related negative self-oriented emotions in empathy-arousing situations</li>
<li>fantasy: the degree to which one responds with empathy toward the emotions or actions</li>
<li>perspective taking: the tendency to adopt the point of view</li>
</ul>
<p>correlations between activity in mirror neuron and limbic 边缘 regions and each of the first three sub-scales</p>
<p>The limited MNS involvement found in studies on pain can be attributed to methodological differences. (fire, BOLD, neuroimaging..)</p>
<h2 id="the-mirror-neuron-system-and-interpersonal-competence">The mirror neuron system and interpersonal competence</h2>
<p>MNS may support some aspects of empathy in both typically developing children and adults.</p>
<p>Hypotheses: MNS may underlie more general social abilities</p>
<p>the greater a child's interpersonal skills, the greater the activity observed in the frontal component of the MNS, as well as in the amygdala and anterior insula.</p>
<p>-&gt; MNS and its interface with the limbic system via the anterior insula, play a significant role in everyday social functioning.</p>
<p>MNS dysfunction in autism</p>
<h2 id="conclusions-and-future-directions">Conclusions and future directions</h2>
<p>the human MNS is associated with individual differences in affective components of empathy —— shared emotional states —— as well as with more general social abilities</p>
<p>especially prominent in children in line with the notion that shared affect may provide a neural and behavioral foundation for interpersonal understanding</p>
<p>less clear: MNS &amp; cognitive components of empathy (like perspective taking)</p>
<p>depending on whether the processes involve the use of information gathered via the MNS or via other mechanisms</p>
<p>eg. I know you are sad by looking at you || because I heard your dog had to be put to sleep</p>
<p>Q: what group or individual differences might affect MNS functioning in relation to empathy (eg. gender differences, females on average exhibit stronger MNS involvement)</p>
<p>in children and adults as well as in monkeys, behavioral empathy is known to increase with greater similarity between oneself and the target (species, personality, age, gender..) mirror neurons may possess sensitivities of this sort.</p>
<p>Gender might be the first meaningful social group to affect MNS functioning, since:</p>
<ul>
<li>strong same-sex preferences for play partners develop at an early age and result in persistent gender segregation until puberty</li>
<li>gender is also associated with differences in action/play styles, body type, and facial structure</li>
</ul>
