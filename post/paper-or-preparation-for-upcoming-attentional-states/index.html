                            <p>❗️Primary question:</p>
<p><strong>whether the hippo-campus and vmPFC can use memory to prepare for upcoming attentional states</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstract</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goal-directed attention is usually studied by providing individuals with explicit instructions on what they should attend to.</p>
<p><strong>but</strong> in daily life -&gt; use <strong>past experiences</strong></p>
<p><em>hypothesized</em> that memory-guided attention is supported by <strong>neural preparation</strong> for anticipated attentional states.</p>
<p><em>examined</em>  <strong>preparatory coding</strong> in the human hippo-campus and mPFC</p>
<p><em>tasks</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>attention was guided by memory</li>
<li>attention was explicitly instructed</li>
</ul>
<p><em>results</em>: Exhibited higher activity for <strong>memory-guided</strong>.</p>
<p>​          -&gt; Representations contained info about upcoming attentional states.</p>
<p>​           &amp; memory-guided attention have stronger preparation.</p>
<p>​           &amp; Stronger coupled with visual cortex.</p>
<p><strong>Memories are used to prepare for upcoming attentional goals.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Introduction</p>
</blockquote>
<p>info overload -&gt; only a small portion can be processed</p>
<p><strong>question: How do we figure out what to attend and what to ignore?</strong></p>
<p>Studies <em>have shown</em> humans can guide attention based on top-down goals.</p>
<p>But in daily life we seldom receive explicit instructions.</p>
<p><em>Our attentional states are often guided by past experiences in similar situations.</em></p>
<p><strong>define</strong> &quot;attentional state&quot; as the prioritized processing of particular environmental features.</p>
<p><strong>candidate regions</strong> are hippo-campus and medial prefrontal cortex.</p>
<p>(Interactions between them have been linked to goal-directed behaviors guided by long-term memory)</p>
<p>Hippo-campus plays a role in encoding and retrieving long-term memories.</p>
<p><strong>Possibilities</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The hippo-campus retrieves a memory and then it is used by other brain areas to guide attention</li>
<li>The hippo-campus is engaged in the process of guiding attention</li>
</ul>
<p>-&gt; Based on previous studies, guessing it can also represent attentional goals</p>
<p>mPFC have neural synchrony with hippo-campus at decision points in which memory must be used to guide future behavior.</p>
<p>The orbitofrontal cortex represents goal state representations inferred on the basis of past experience; the hippo-campus and ventromedial PFC show functional coupling as individuals learn which features of an object are relevant for determining its category.</p>
<p><em>use behavioral task and representational similarity analyses</em></p>
<p>Firstly, seeking to determine <strong>whether these regions can differentiate between different online attentional states</strong>, and then testing <strong>whether neural signatures of these states can be detected prior to the attentional task itself</strong>. -&gt; prepare for upcoming attentional states</p>
<p>The tasks require <em>relational representations</em> to be strong drivers of hippocampal function.</p>
<p>Participants fist came in for a behavioral practice session approximately 2 days before the fMRI scan. 3 phases: the explicitly instructed task; the stay/switch cue learning phase; memory-guided task.</p>
<p><strong>Tasks</strong>:</p>
<p>Show sequentially presented images of 3D-renered rooms.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Exp: cue to pay attention to either the style of the paintings or the spatial layout of the rooms -&gt; base image -&gt; search images: indicate whether any of the paintings could have been painted by the same person/indicate whether any of the rooms had the same spatial layout-&gt; make decision.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mem: learn stay and switch cues -&gt; same with the exp but no cue, choose ART or ROOM by the prior trial' stay/switch cue. Means, if trial 1 has a stay cue(picture) in it, then you choose the same cue(art or room) for trial 2. If no cue, choose freely.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are valid and invalid trials (last question match the first cue or not)</p>
<p>Only valid trials were used in some fMRI analyses</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Results</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Behavior</strong></p>
<p><strong>Goals</strong>: determine if</p>
<ul>
<li>attention was effectively manipulated</li>
<li>performance was rough equivalent across two tasks -&gt; ensure the differences in brain activity are unlikely to be driven by task difficulty</li>
</ul>
<p>Sensitivity was higher on valid trials and RT was shorter.</p>
<p>-&gt; manipulation of attentional states was successful</p>
<p>Compare behavioral performance across two tasks and compare valid trials only, both no statistically significant difference.</p>
<p>Ensure stay/switch choices were generally right and no significant difference between stay and switch</p>
<p>-&gt; similar modulations by cue validity</p>
<p><strong>fMRI</strong></p>
<p><em>Activity enhancement</em></p>
<p>Compare BOLD activity in these regions during the task to determine if they are more involved in attentional behaviors. And find it higher for the memory-guided task.</p>
<p>Examine across individuals to determine the difference is not led solely by differences in behavioral performance.</p>
<p>Examine across individuals and find the activity enhancement in each region for memory-guided attention was strongly correlated. And the correlation remained when controlling for individual differences in behavioral performance across tasks.</p>
<p>-&gt; The hippo-campus and vmPFC play a similar functional role in memory-guided attention and may be working together.</p>
<p><strong>Representations of current and upcoming attentional goals</strong></p>
<p>differentiate two periods: image; orienting</p>
<p>guessing: these regions will show preparatory coding during the orienting period and thus activity patterns will resemble the attentional state (image period)</p>
<p>first: to find different attentional states for art/room</p>
<p>then: correlate these activity patterns as a function of the participants' attentional state, if a brain region represents online attentional states, then pattern similarity should be higher for trials of the same state (thus can examine preparatory attentional states)</p>
<p>third: test whether they also represent the preparatory states</p>
<ul>
<li>calculate &quot;template&quot; patterns of activity by averaging activity patterns</li>
<li>correlated activity patterns during orienting period with 2 templates and binned them based on whether the template matched the orienting cue or not</li>
<li>repeated for each trial and averaged</li>
<li>calculated the difference between match-to-same-template pattern similarity and match-to-different-template pattern similarity  (if preparatory coding ,then should resemble the same-state template)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
<p>hippo-campus: activity patterns resembled the upcoming attentional state more than the other attentional state but <em>this effect was also observed when attention was explicitly instructed</em>. However, <em>states for memory-guided were stronger</em>.</p>
<p>vmPFC: <em>this effect was not significantly different between the tasks</em></p>
<p>-&gt; The hippo-campus only,  preferentially represented upcoming memory-guided attentional states.</p>
<p><strong>Robustness of preparatory attentional states</strong></p>
<p>preceding analysis use common image period templates that average both tasks to create a template.</p>
<p>And only valid trials. But included no-cue trials because attentional state decisions following these trials still had to be guided by memory (participants need to remember that there's no cue to know the attentional goal could be chosen freely)</p>
<p><strong>argue</strong>: separate image period templates; including invalid trials (contamination should not differ across memory/explicit); no-cue may be less memory-driven;</p>
<p>So replicate the same pattern of result again.</p>
<p><strong>finding:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>the same</li>
<li>the same</li>
<li>hippo-campus failed to reach significance in the explicitly instructed task (note that this analysis is reduced in power because 1/3 of the trials were dropped)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>another potential concern</strong>: autocorrelation due to sluggish hemodynamic signals?</p>
<p>argue:</p>
<ul>
<li>autocorrelation should be higher for the explicitly because RT to initiate is shorter</li>
<li>the image period templates were obtained from different runs to remove within-run autocorrelation</li>
<li>the last brain volume for the orienting period and the first brain volume for the image period were excluded from the analysis (re-analyzed)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Retrieval of past states or preparation for upcoming states?</strong></p>
<p>for the memory-guided task</p>
<p>the switch trial !</p>
<ul>
<li>reflect memory retrieval: resemble the previous attentional state</li>
<li>reflect preparation: resemble the upcoming attentional state</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>finding</strong>: the latter</p>
<p>may involve memory retrieval of task-relevant goals and/or the use of these memories to bias neural processing toward task-relevant features</p>
<p><strong>Hippocampal interactions with visual cortex</strong></p>
<p>question: how to transform memory cues in the environment into preparatory attentional signals ?</p>
<p>guessing: hippocampal interactions with visual cortex are enhanced when memory must be used to guide attention -&gt; allow mnemonically relevant info to be detected</p>
<p>test: functional coupling (focus on visual areas V1-2 because representations in these regions are correlated with those in the hippo-campus)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>determine the quality of attentional states</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>correlated across hippo-campus and V1-2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>confirm V1-2 represents current attentional goals (pattern similarity)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>computed multivariate connectivity</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>-&gt; covariation in attentional states between the hippo-campus and early visual cortex may enable mnemonically relevant info in the environment to be detected and then acted upon</p>
<p><strong>Other measures of neural preparation</strong></p>
<p>Having been focused on multivariate measures but, any univariate activity enhancements in the hippo-campus ?</p>
<p>yes for the image period</p>
<p>not significantly between memory/explicit for orienting period</p>
<p><strong>Attentional preparation in other brain regions</strong></p>
<p>look for regions that show greater preparation for memory-guided vs explicitly instructed attention but no voxels</p>
<p>look for regions that show preparatory coding for either task separately and find a few isolated voxels but no meaningful clusters</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Discussion</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Nature of preparatory attentional states</strong></p>
<p>A number of different cognitive processes can lead to overlap in brain representations for engaging in a task and anticipating it.</p>
<p>One possibility is that preparatory attentional states observed in this study reflect the anticipated difficulty of art and room attentional sates -&gt; if one attentional state much more difficult than stronger evidence of neural preparation is expected. But not find correlations so it is unlikely to be the driving factor.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that participants start to represent concrete visual features related to those categories -&gt; this approach may not be effective because the particular paintings or rooms imagined are unlikely to be the specific ones, a mismatch may hurt performance -&gt; individuals may not bring to mind specific paintings or rooms in preparation</p>
<p><em>Thus</em>, the preparatory attentional states may be relatively abstract in nature.</p>
<p>Might reflect an abstract attentional orientation (attend to what), maintenance of a task instruction (find what), or even a metacognitive state.</p>
<p><em><strong>So what those abstractions are is not clear.</strong></em></p>
<p><em>limitation</em>: the absence of a long period of no visual stimulation between the orienting period and the image period. (But many actions may have helped)</p>
<p><em>If fMRI were complemented with EEG to incorporate the high temporal resolution may be better.</em></p>
<p><strong>What kind of memory is used to guide attention</strong></p>
<p>Believe: long-term memory, intermediate-term memory and working memory all contribute.</p>
<p>Long-term: the stay/switch cues were well-learned ~30 minutes prior to the fMRI scan. Semantic memories can contribute in daily life but in the study the contributes might more closely resemble episodic memories. Semantic: like the traffic signs, they are learned and practiced over a lifetime.</p>
<p>Intermediate-term: (between long-term and working memory) for what occurred on the previous trial. This memory (store the previous attentional state &amp; cue/intention—whether it is for the intention or for the stay/switch cue) might be stored as an episodic trace during the inter-trail interval and recalled at the beginning of the next trial.</p>
<p>Working memory: attentional templates stored in working memory.</p>
<p><em>Future studies will be useful for understanding the similarities and differences between attentional guidance by memories at these timescales.</em></p>
<p><strong>Future directions</strong></p>
<p>Why only the hippo-campus?</p>
<ul>
<li>vmPFC might weight explicit instructions and memories equally when preparing while the hippo-campus may prioritized information that is retrieved from memory.</li>
<li>the hippo-campus is capable of preparing equally strongly but we were not able to observe this due to limitations of the experimental design.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mention:</strong> the upcoming attentional state was known for longer in the memory-guided since attentional stated for trial N were known as soon as trial N-1 was over.</p>
<p>And since there's no delay after the cue, maybe vmPFC stated relatively soon while the hippo-campus needs more time. -&gt; EEG</p>
<p>How does the hippo-campus balance the demand between externally and internally oriented attention?</p>
<ul>
<li>rapidly fluctuate between internal and external modes, prioritizing either attention/encoding or memory retrieval at different timepoints, and a cue switched the state</li>
</ul>

<li>Memories frequently guide attention.</li>
<li>The hippo-campus and vmPFC prepare for anticipated attentional states.</li>
<li>The hippo-campus prepare more on the basis of memory.</li>
<li>Attentional states in the hippo-campus correlate with those in early visual cortex then attention is guided by memories.</li>
<li>So the process calls on representations in and coordination between systems involved in memory and perception.</li>
